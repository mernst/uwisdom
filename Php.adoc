To change the memory
available to PHP, use `ini_set ("memory_limit", "32M")`.
There are similar settings for the time limit.
Look at 'php ini' for the full list of settings.

To open a stream (file resource) that corresponds to stdout (output to the
browser) in non-cli php (webserver app) use:
```
   $stdout = fopen ("php://output", "w"); 
```

To get the values of variables use the php superglobal variable $_REQUEST
(superglobals do not need to be declared with the global keyword).
$_REQUEST is an associative array that contains the values of each
input variable from a form or url.  It contains the contents of
$_GET, $_POST, and $_COOKIE.  See 
http://us2.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.request.php
