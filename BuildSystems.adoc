== Make and Makefiles

make: "error 139" means that your program segfaulted:  139 = 128+11, and 11
is a segfault (http://www.bitwizard.nl/sig11/).

Make has two flavors of variables that may appear in a Makefile.
The normal type is recursively expanded, re-evaluated on each use:
```
     foo = $(bar)
```
The GNU-specific type is simply expanded, set once when the assignment is
encountered.
```
     x := foo
```

In Makefiles, variables in rule targets and dependences are expanded as
soon as the rule target is read, but variables in rule actions are expanded
only when the action is actually executed.  Watch out for this
inconsistency!  This means that rules with variables in their
targets/dependences should come at the end of Makefiles.

In a Makefile, the right way to invoke make on a subdirectory or other
directory is
```
             cd subdir && $(MAKE)
```
or, equivalently,
```
             $(MAKE) -C subdir
```
To execute parallel jobs on a multiprocessor, use the "-j2" option.

In make, to ensure that a rule always runs even if the target seems to be
up to date, add an extra rule of the form
```
     .PHONY : clean
```
Once this is done, `make clean' will run the commands regardless of
whether there is a file named `clean'.

After Makefile.in is changed, it is necessary to rerun "config.status" and
then rerun "make".

Particularly useful special "automatic variables" used by make (in Makefile rules):
//nobreak

 * $@   the target of the rule
 * $<   the first prerequisite
 * $^   all the prerequisites
 * $*   the stem with which an implicit rule matches, including directory name
Example use of special automatic variables used by make:
`cp -p $< $@`

In Makefiles, to test whether a file/directory exists, do something like this:
```
  # Test that the directory exists.  There must be a better way to do this.
  INV:=$(wildcard $(INV))
  ifndef INV
    $(error Environment variable INV is not set to an existing directory)
  endif
```
or alternately:
```
  ifeq "$(wildcard ${INV}/scripts)" "${INV}/scripts"
       ... it exists ...
  else
       ... it does not exist ...
  endif
```
or:
```
ifneq ("$(wildcard $(PATH_TO_FILE))","")
FILE_EXISTS = 1
else
FILE_EXISTS = 0
endif
```

Suppose I want to write a rule that always performs a task, but doesn't
necessarily cause its dependence to execute first.  This is a snippet of
the Makefile I would like to write:
```
.PHONY: maybe-update-file1
maybe-update-file1:
	Command A:  may or may not update file1.txt
file2.txt:  maybe-update-file1 file1.txt
	Command B:  computes file2.txt from file1.txt
```
Problem: because the maybe-update-file1 target always executes, Command B
always executes.  That wastes the time to execute Command B, and because it
unconditionally updates file2.txt, any command that depends on file2.txt
also executes unnecessarily.
 +
Here is an approach that works:
```
file2.txt: maybe-update-file1 .timestamp-file2
.PHONY: maybe-update-file1
maybe-update-file1:
	@if [ `fortune | wc -l` -eq 1 ] ; then echo touch file1.txt; touch file1.txt; fi
.timestamp-file2: file1.txt
	cp file1.txt file2.txt
	touch .timestamp-file2
```

The directory of the current Makefile:
```
THIS_MAKEFILE:=$(word $(words $(MAKEFILE_LIST)),$(MAKEFILE_LIST))
```



== Ant and buildfiles, build.xml

An Ant guide (documentation) for beginners:
http://wiki.apache.org/ant/TheElementsOfAntStyle

To permit user-specific setting of variables in a Makefile, add this at the
top (and change assignments to use "=?" syntax):
```
  # Put user-specific changes in your own Makefile.user.
  # Make will silently continue if that file does not exist.
  -include Makefile.user
```

To make a tags table for a LaTeX paper, using an Ant buildfile:
```
  <target name="etags" depends="tags">
  </target>
  <target name="tags" depends="init" description="builds Emacs TAGS table">
    <exec os="Linux" executable="etags" failonerror="true">
      <!-- args explicitly specified so that they are in the right order -->
      <!-- To regenerate, run:  latex-process-inputs -antlist main.tex -->
      ...
    </exec>
  </target>
```
To make a tags table for a Java project, using an Ant buildfile:
```
  <target name="etags" depends="tags">
  </target>
  <target name="tags" description="Create Emacs TAGS table">
    <exec executable="/bin/sh">
      <arg value="-c"/>
      <arg value="etags `find -name '*.java' | sort-directory-order`"/>
    </exec>
  </target>
```

To print out a path in ant, use this snippet of code at the end of your ant
file.  This is good for debugging classpath issues when running javac, as
ant ordinarily doesn't let you see the classpath or the javac command line.
```
  <!-- = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = =
       macrodef: echopath
       Use as:    <echopath pathid="mypath"/>
       = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = -->
  <macrodef name="echopath">
    <attribute name="pathid"/>
    <sequential>
      <property name="line.pathprefix" value="| |-- "/>
      <!-- get given path in a printable form -->
      <pathconvert pathsep="${line.separator}${line.pathprefix}"
       property="echo.@{pathid}"
       refid="@{pathid}">
      </pathconvert>
      <echo>Path @{pathid}</echo>
      <echo>${line.pathprefix}${echo.@{pathid}}</echo>
    </sequential>
  </macrodef>
```

To print a fileset in Ant:
```
    <macrodef name="echo-fileset">
		    <attribute name="filesetref" />
		    <sequential>
		    <pathconvert pathsep="\n " property="@{filesetref}.echopath">
				    <path>
					    <fileset refid="@{filesetref}" />
				    </path>
			    </pathconvert>
		    <echo>   ------- echoing fileset @{filesetref} -------</echo>
		    <echo>${@{filesetref}.echopath}</echo>
		    </sequential>
    </macrodef>
...
    <echo-fileset filesetref="src.files"/>
```

To access environment variables in Ant:
```
  <property environment="env"/>
```
and then use
```
  ${env.HOME}
```

A recipe for a temporary directory in Ant:
```
  <property name="tmpdir" location="${java.io.tmpdir}/${user.name}/${ant.project.name}" />
  <delete dir="${tmpdir}" />    
  <mkdir dir="${tmpdir}" />
```

ant wildcards - ** means the current directory or any directory
below it.  I still can't find where this is documented.

In Ant, to check whether files have the same contents, there is no "diff"
task but you can use the "filesmatch" condition.

In Ant, to convert a relative filename/pathname to absolute, use:
```
  <property name="x" location="folder/file.txt" />
```
and ${X} will be the absolute path of the file relative to the ${basedir} value.
In general, for a file or directory, it's less error-prone to use
```
  <property name="x" location="folder/file.txt" />
```
rather than
```
  <property name="x" value="folder/file.txt" />
```
Also consider using ${basedir}, which is already absolute.
It defaults to the containing directory of the buildfile, and it can appear
in a build.properties file.
A slightly less clean approach than ${basedir} is
```
  <dirname property="ant.file.dir" file="${ant.file}"/>
```

Ant permits you to specify that one target depends on another, but by
default every prerequisite is always rebuilt, even if it is already up to
date.  (This is a key difference between Ant and make:  by default, make
only re-builds a target if some prerequisite is newer.)
 +
To make Ant re-build prerequisites only if necessary, there are two general
approaches.
//nobreak

 1. Use the uptodate task to set a property.  Then, your task can test the
   property and build only if the property is (not) set.
----
  <uptodate property="mytarget.uptodate">  // in set.mytarget.uptodate task
    ...
  </uptodate>
  <!-- The prerequisites are executed before the "unless" is checked. -->
  <target name="mytarget" depends="set.mytarget.uptodate" unless="mytarget.uptodate">
    ...
  </target>
----
   Alternately, use the outofdate task from ant contrib.  It's nicer in
   that it is just one target without a separate property being defined; by
   contrast, outofdate requires separate targets to set and to test the
   property.
 2. Create a <fileset> using the <modified> selector.  It calculates MD5
   hashes for files and selects files whose MD5 differs from earlier stored
   values.  It's optional to set
```
     <param name="cache.cachefile"     value="cache.properties"/>
```
   inside the <modified> selector; it defaults to "cache.properties".
   Example that copies all files from src to dest whose content has changed:
```
        <copy todir="dest">
            <fileset dir="src">
                <modified/>
            </fileset>
        </copy>
```
There is also Ivy, but I can't tell from its documentation whether it
provides this feature.  The key use case in the documentation seems to be
downloading subprojects from the Internet rather than avoiding wasted work
by staging the parts of a single project.

In Ant, the path to the current ant build file (typically build.xml) is 
available as property `ant.file`.  You can get its directory in this way:
----
<dirname property="ant.file.dir" file="${ant.file}"/>
----

In Ant, to jar up the contents of a set of existing .jar files:
```
    <zip destfile="out.jar">
	<zipgroupfileset dir="lib" includes="*.jar"/>
    </zip>
```

Vizant (http://vizant.sourceforge.net/) is an ant build visualization tool.

To make the junit task work in Ant without setting classpath, use the hack from:
http://wiki.osuosl.org/display/howto/Running+JUnit+Tests+from+Ant+without+making+classpath+changes

To list the projects (top-level targets) in an Ant build.xml file, do either of:
```
  ant -projecthelp
  ant -p
```

To get the current working directory from an ant file:
```
  ${bsh:WorkDirPath.getPath()}
```

To pass the -Xlint argument to javac when running from Ant, do:
```
      <compilerarg value="-Xlint"/>
```


== Maven and pom.xml

In a Maven buildfiel pom.xml, here is where to put <plugins>:
```
<build>
  <plugins>
  ...
```

I give up on using Maven to upload artifacts to Maven Central.  There are several different plugins that are intended to do this, but their documentation is uniformly bad (or at least it assumes great familiarity with Maven) and I couldn't get any of them to work despite significant effort.  Their error messages are extremely obscure, too.
By contrast, Gradle has fewer plugins and I got one to work.



== Gradle and build.gradle

The standard gradle target, which builds all artifacts and runs all tests, is
```
./gradlew build
```

When debugging gradle, use `--info` (less verbose) or `--debug` (more verbose).

Gradle task to create a TAGS table:
```
/* Make Emacs TAGS table */
task tags(type: Exec, dependsOn: 'clone') {
  description "Run etags to create an Emacs TAGS table"
  environment PATH: "$System.env.PATH:$buildDir/utils/plume-lib/bin"
  commandLine "bash", "-c", "find src/ -name '*.java' | sort-directory-order | xargs etags"
}
```

To replace a remote dependency by a local one in Gradle, do:
```
implementation files('libs/options-0.2.2-all.jar')
```

To test a new version of a Gradle dependency locally, you have several options:
\nobreak

 * create a local Gradle repository
 * Edit the build.gradle file, for instance by changing
   ```implementation 'org.plumelib:bcel-util:1.1.3'```
   to 
   ```implementation files("${rootDir}/libs/bcel-util-all.jar")```
 * Overwrite the `.jar` file in a subdirectory of
   `~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/` .
   This does not require changing your build.gradle file.
   Since you now have locally cached a different version than is in Maven
   Central, your local builds will not be the same as for other people.
   So you should probably delete the versions you put there when you are done
   with your experiments.

In Travis CI, it's a good idea to enable Gradle caching of downloaded
artifacts.  It reduces bandwidth and time usage, and more importantly it
reduces transient failures that happen due to loss/reduction of network
connectivity.
```
# Enable Gradle and Maven caching
before_cache:
  - rm -f  $HOME/.gradle/caches/modules-2/modules-2.lock
  - rm -fr $HOME/.gradle/caches/*/plugin-resolution/
cache:
  directories:
    - $HOME/.gradle/caches/
    - $HOME/.gradle/wrapper/
    - $HOME/.m2
```
To enable it within a Docker container:
```
docker run -v $HOME/.gradle:/root/.gradle -v $HOME/.m2:/root/.m2 USER/IMAGE-NAME /bin/bash -c "..."
```
Travis says not to cache Docker images:
https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/caching/#things-not-to-cache

Preparing the Gradle buildfile for uploading/releasing to Maven Central:
Set up directory:
1. Run once ever: ln -s ../../../gradle.properties gradle.properties
2. Add gradle.properties to .gitignore file.
3. Gradle buildfile rules:
http://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html
Here are alternate, but worse, sources of Gradle buildfile rules:
 * This doesn't give instructions about Maven Central in particular:
   https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/maven_plugin.html
 * The "maven-publish" plugin doesn't support signing which Maven Central requires:
   https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/publishing_maven.html

To make a release to Maven Central using Gradle:
0. Create Gradle files using http://central.sonatype.org/pages/gradle.html
1. Increment the version number in buildfiles, documentation (README files), etc.
2. Run one of these:
```
./gradlew uploadArchives
./gradlew -b mavencentral.gradle uploadArchives
```
3. Manually release the deployment:
3a.  Browse to https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories
3b.  Search for and select this repository, by group name.
3c.  At the top, click "close" then "refresh" then "release".
     You might have to wait a little while between the clicks.
     Use the release message "Plume-lib Options X.Y.Z" (w/version number).
Artifacts should be available in 10+ minutes.
They will show up at search.maven.org in 2 hours.


To set up a Java project to build with Gradle (to create a build.gradle file):
1. `gradle wrapper --gradle-version 4.5`
(Use version 4.1 to avoid warning about using Java 7.)
2. Run one of the following lines:
```
./gradlew init --type java-library
./gradlew init --type java-application
```

Gradle 4.1 is the last version that does not complain about use of Java 7.
The entire 4.x series works on Java 7, but issues distracting warnings about it.
To use Gradle 4.1:
```
gradle wrapper --gradle-version 4.1
```

You can include a remote Gradle build script by doing:
```
apply from: "http://path/to/script.gradle"
```
The downside of this is that it downloads every time; there is no caching.
And maybe it doesn't work offline?

To visualize the task dependencies in a Gradle buildfile:
```
plugins {
    id "com.dorongold.task-tree" version "1.3"
}
```
Then run
```
gradle SOMETASKNAME taskTree
```
When one of the tasks given to the gradle command is `taskTree`, execution
of all the other tasks on that line is skipped. Instead, their task
dependency tree is printed.

Gradle's `--dry-run` only shows the tasks that would have run, not their
actions/commands like make's `--dry-run` does.

Gradle buildfile rules to run Error Prone linter on each compilation:
```
plugins {
  // Run the Error Prone linter.
  id "net.ltgt.errorprone-base" version "0.0.16"
}
dependencies {
  errorprone 'com.google.errorprone:error_prone_core:2.3.1'
}
```

To see which files Gradle's shadowJar plugin/task will put in a fat jarfile:
```
    doFirst {
      println sourceSets.main.runtimeClasspath.asPath
    }
```

To exclude a file from Gradle's shadowJar plugin/task:
```
shadowJar {
  // Toxic classfile, crashes Gradle (because ASM considers it malformed)
  exclude 'org.plumelib.util.OrderedPairIterator'
}
```

To solve the Gradle problem "Timeout waiting to lock daemon addresses
registry. It is currently in use by another Gradle instance..", remove all
Gradle lock files:
```
find ~ -type f -name "*.lock" | grep /.gradle/ | while read f; do rm $f; done
```
Possibly also `kill -9` the process number mentioned in the Gradle output.

The gradle error "Error snapshotting jar [httpclient-4.5.3.jar]" might be
due to a corrupted Gradle cache.  Blow away the cache (on Travis, comment
out the line, do a build, then re-enable; or leave it uncommented since the
problem may recur at any time).


== Testing local version of Checker Framework by overwriting local caches

To copy the Checker Framework to the Gradle and Maven local caches:
(Must update artifact IDs when updating $VER!)
```
VER=2.5.4 && \
(cd $CHECKERFRAMEWORK && ./gradlew copyJarsToDist) && \
\cp -pf $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/dist/checker.jar ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.checkerframework/checker/${VER}/eab2b4c17da64f186aadfdd301ec0c4a581f7b/checker-${VER}.jar && \
\cp -pf $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/dist/checker-qual.jar ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.checkerframework/checker-qual/${VER}/fba37cca207f6dd3f0f0a2c42018bd8f565f986a/checker-qual-${VER}.jar && \
\cp -pf $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/dist/jdk8.jar ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.checkerframework/jdk8/${VER}/bf66e86a3e11108b0f22badf159396f9eb88a916/jdk8-${VER}.jar && \
\cp -pf $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/dist/checker.jar ~/.m2/repository/org/checkerframework/checker/${VER}/checker-${VER}.jar && \
\cp -pf $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/dist/checker-qual.jar ~/.m2/repository/org/checkerframework/checker-qual/${VER}/checker-qual-${VER}.jar && \
\cp -pf $CHECKERFRAMEWORK/checker/dist/jdk8.jar ~/.m2/repository/org/checkerframework/jdk8/${VER}/jdk8-${VER}.jar
```
To clean the Gradle and Maven local caches (rarely needed):
```
VER=2.5.4 && \
rm -rf \
  ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.checkerframework/checker/${VER}/ \
  ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.checkerframework/checker-qual/${VER}/ \
  ~/.gradle/caches/modules-2/files-2.1/org.checkerframework/jdk8/${VER}/ \
  ~/.m2/repository/org/checkerframework/checker/${VER}/ \
  ~/.m2/repository/org/checkerframework/checker-qual/${VER}/ \
  ~/.m2/repository/org/checkerframework/jdk8/${VER}/
```
