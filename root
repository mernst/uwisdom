// Generic top-level wisdom file.  If file root_user exists, it is
// used instead.  Therefore, a root_user file is often of the form
//   \include{root}
//   \include{my-personal-file1}
//   \include{my-personal-file2}
//   ...

// Users must choose to explicitly include these files, which are not included
// by default: `Afs.md`, `Mit.md`, `Uw.md`.

// Files `JavaFormatters.md`, `JavaTools.md`, and `README.md` are not included,
// because they are not organized as lots of small nuggets of searchable
// information.
