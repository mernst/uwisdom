// Generic top-level wisdom file.  If file root_user exists, it is
// used instead.  Therefore, a root_user file is often of the form
//   \include{root}
//   \include{my-personal-file1}
//   \include{my-personal-file2}
//   ...
// Note that files `Afs.md`, `Mit.md`, and `Uw.md` are not included in this file;
// users must include them explicitly.
