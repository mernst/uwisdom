  Can do any of: Java (google-java-format, eclipse jdt, clang-format, prettier, palantir-java-format)
  Configuration:
    https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/tree/main/plugin-gradle#java
    https://github.com/apache/beam/blob/1d9daf1aca101fa5a194cbbba969886734e08902/buildSrc/src/main/groovy/org/apache/beam/gradle/BeamModulePlugin.groovy#L776-L789
  I should create a `typeAnnotations()` filter within `java` that is a postprocessing step, just like run-google-java-format does now.
    See https://github.com/diffplug/spotless/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
    It has an "Integration testing" section too.
  It would be analogous to "GoogleJavaFormatStep.java".
  Spotless supports only some configuration options, but I could add more more in file "GoogleJavaFormatStep.java".

https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormat.html
  To install: sudo apt install clang-format -y
  To run: clang-format --style=Google -i
  "--qualifier-alignment=<string> - If set, overrides the qualifier alignment style
                                   determined by the QualifierAlignment style flag"
  Formats @SuppressWarnings wrong:
    -    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
    -    T[] result = (T[]) Array.newInstance(o.getClass(), n);
    +    @SuppressWarnings("unchecked") T[] result = (T[]) Array.newInstance(o.getClass(), n);
  It would be better to have a space between an annotation and a set of array brackets:
    -    ListOrArray(T @Nullable [] theArray) {
    +    ListOrArray(T @Nullable[] theArray) {
  Formats type annotatios wrong:
    -    @NonNegative int size() {
    +    @NonNegative
    +    int size() {
  Overall, google-java-format makes better choices for line breaks, e.g., in assertions.
  clang-format is more concise, e.g. it puts multiple formal parameters on the same line.

palantir-java-format
  A fork of google-java-format.
  Maybe they would take a pull request with names of other type annotations...
  Looks like it might default to 4-space indentation?
  They seem to be a fair distance behind google-java-format; for example, as of August 2022 they do not have this 1-year-old commit about type annotations:

spring-javaformat: https://github.com/spring-io/spring-javaformat
  "It is effectively limited to adding or removing whitespace and line feeds."
  "switching to spaces is the one configuration option that we do support."
  120 character width.  What is indentation: 4 spaces?
  "Keeping whitespace lines out of method bodies can help make the code easier to scan.": so it removes all blank lines?
Vim: vim MyClass.java <<< gg=G:wq
  echo -e "G=gg\n:wq\n" | vim ./myfile.php
  "Unfortunately this doesn't work nicely when you have several java annotations before a method (e.g. @Override, @Deprecated)"

  I sent mail asking whether it handles type annotations.

Not good enough:

google-java-format: The authors refuse to build in names of well-known type annotations.

OpenRewrite
  https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite
  Add to `build.gradle` file:
    plugins {
	id("org.openrewrite.rewrite") version("5.26.3")
    }
    rewrite {
	activeRecipe("org.openrewrite.java.format.AutoFormat")
    }
  Then run: ./gradlew rewriteRun
    This compiles the project -- I'm not sure why.
  Crashes when run on my projects.
  Removes annotated receiver parameters!  But leaves in the colon, which results in illegal Java files.
  By default uses 4-character indentation.
  Put this in a file named rewrite.yml:
  - org.openrewrite.java.style.TabsAndIndentsStyle:
      indentSize: 2
  "OpenRewrite recipes make minimally invasive changes to your source code that honor the original formatting."
