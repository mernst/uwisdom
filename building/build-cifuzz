The maintainers have taken the cifuzz tool repository private.  Maybe it's no longer generally available?

All the installation instructions are broken (dead links), so I cannot figure out how to install cifuzz/ci-fuzz.

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CodeIntelligenceTesting/cifuzz/main/install.sh)"
