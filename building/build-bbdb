# BBDB 2.35 (released 1/2007) is the last release in the 2.x series.
# As of 7/2014, BBDBv3 is alpha quality; don't be eager to upgrade.
# Today, BBDB 3 is probably fine, but don't use it because it lacks integration with Mew.

cd ~/emacs
wget http://bbdb.sourceforge.net/bbdb-2.35.tar.gz
tar zxf bbdb-2.35.tar.gz
cd bbdb-2.35
./configure
make all
# In Sep 2020, the above fails in "make info".  Ignore that for now.

rm -f ~/emacs/.path.el

[I'm experimenting with skipping the below.]
# ??
# It may take some additional trickery to get this into the load-path, such as:
cd ..
ln -s bbdb-2.35 bbdb
