Install Adobe Digital Editions

Now, DRM is automatically removed from books as they are imported into Calibre.
https://manual.calibre-ebook.com/faq.html says:
  When you purchase an epub book from a website, you will get an ”.acsm” file.
   * Open this file with Adobe Digital Editions.
      * Double-click on the item, or
      * Use these steps from within the Adobe Digital Editions program:
         * Use the "Add to Library" menu item (there is no "open" menu item)
         * It's in the Downloads folder.
         * You have to change the file type to .acsm in the open file dialog.
   * That puts the ".epub" book in C:\Users\Michael Ernst\Documents\My Digital Editions
      * WSL path (just for checking it is there):
        /mnt/c/Users/mernst/Documents/My Digital Editions
 Open Calibre
  * click "Add books", select that book
     The DRM is stripped as the files are added to the library.
  * Click "Convert books" (third big icon on the top row)
     * Convert to AZW3 format (upper right corner)
     * Click "OK" (lower right corner)
     * Result is written to:
         C:\Users\Michael Ernst\Calibre Library\...
       which on WSL is:
         /c/Users/mernst/Calibre Library/
     * I should perhaps save it elsewhere in case I want to re-download.
Now, download to Kindle
  /media/${USER}/Kindle
