Give up on installing eslint and jshint.
Instead, paste my code into
http://jshint.com/
every time (!).

===========================================================================

# To install eslint, I need npm.
# It should be installed along with node.js, so install node.js
# See ~/wisdom/building/build-node.js

# Then, to install eslint, just do:
npm i -g eslint

# From a terminal (not within Emacs):
eslint --init

Now, I have to run eslint like this, not using plain "eslint"!!
~/node_modules/.bin/eslint yourfile.js
But that doesn't work either...


It's easier to install jshint:
npm install -g jshint
but it didn't find an undefined variable, which is the thing I am most interested in.
