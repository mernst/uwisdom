Neil Spring's style checker:

cd ~/bin/src
wget http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nspring/software/style-check-current.tar.gz
tar xzf style-check-current.tar.gz 
cd style-check-0.9
make user-install
# The user-install command puts the rules in ~/.style-check.d
(cd ~/bin/share; ln -s ../src/style-check-0.9/style-check.rb .)

To use it:
  style-check.rb *.tex
Or, if you'd like a little justification with your scolding,
  style-check.rb -v *.tex

For instance, add to your Makefile:
style: style-check
style-check:
	style-check.rb ${TEX_FILES}
style-check-v:
	style-check.rb -v ${TEX_FILES}

I tried this 4/6/2006, and I found the vast numbers of false positives very
annoying; I don't think it's very useful in its current form, and it would
take a lot of effort to tune it to be better.
