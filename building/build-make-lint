Makefile linters:

https://crates.io/crates/unmake
  To install: cargo install unmake
  To run: unmake .
  I found it not useful: it only raised lots of obscure false positives.

https://github.com/checkmake/checkmake
  This didn't work: To run: go run github.com/checkmake/checkmake/cmd/checkmake@latest MyMakefile
  To install:
  cd ~/tmp
  git clone https://github.com/checkmake/checkmake
  cd checkmake
  BUILDER_EMAIL=x make checkmake
  To run: ~/tmp/checkmake/checkmake/checkmake $(findfile Makefile)
  I found it not useful: it only warned about "multiple definitions" that were actually in separate branches of an `if`.

https://github.com/EbodShojaei/bake
  To run: uvx mbake format --check Makefile
    Formatting is fine, except that it removes newlines at end of files.  :-(
  To run: uvx mbake validate Makefile
    Issues false positive errors for a Makefile that just defines variables and includes another Makefile, but does not explicitly define any targets of its own.
    Runs very slowly.
