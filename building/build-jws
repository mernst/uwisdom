Download file jws3.0.sparc-S2.tar.Z

Installation instructions: www.sun.com/workshop/java/install.html 
Essentially, just untar the file (it untars into current directory, doesn't
create its own directory).
I did this into ~/se/java/jws3.0/.

To run: 
~/se/java/jws3.0/Java-WorkShop3.0/sparc-S2/bin/jws &

I don't get correct behavior from the UI, however.
For instance, I often need to resize dialog boxes to see everything in
them.
And I wasn't able to set the classpath so I could compile.

And I couldn't figure out how to consistently change projects, interrupt
programs, etc.
