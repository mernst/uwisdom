Mailcrypt is only useful if you are using PGP or GPG.
For simple encryption/decryption, I use crypt++.el instead.

./configure --prefix=/uns/share
# Edit makefile:
#   EMACS = emacs-19
make				# byte-compile Emacs files
# Make /uns/share/info/dir editable by me (visit in Emacs, C-x C-q).
make install
# Probably undo changes to /uns/share/info/dir (in Emacs, C-x v u).
# This installs timer.el[c] into site-lisp; that must be deleted, as it
#  causes Emacs 20.3 to fail.

To switch between versions of PGP, use   M-x mc-setversion RET.
