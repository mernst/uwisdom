[New version as of June 4, 1999: ftp://majesty.fac.cs.cmu.edu/lackwit-dist/sun4_55.tar.gz]

The Lackwit tar file extracts into the current directory.

When running the demo:
Change Makefile:
  -include Makefile.@sys
  +include Makefile.solaris
Create Makefile.solaris:
  cp -p Makefile.sun4_413 Makefile.solaris
Edit Makefile.solaris:
  -KRBINCDIR=/usr/local/include
  -KRBLIBDIR=/usr/local/lib
  +KRBINCDIR=/usr/include/kerberos
  +KRBLIBDIR=/usr/lib
  -DESINCDIR=/usr/local/include
  +DESINCDIR=/usr/include/des/
I couldn't find libdes* in /uns/lib/, /usr/lib/, or /usr/local/lib/.  Where
is it?

Each time before I run Lackwit, do (in a separate shell, so I don't
contaminate my other work):
  setenv PATH $LACKWIT_HOME/bin:$PATH
Then do:
  EmitHeaders $LACKWIT_HOME/lib/Default.sigs 
  gcc -c $LACKWIT_HOME/lib/libc.c -o /dev/null
One of these:
  make
  Lackwit foo2.c
Then, to query:
  BackEnd

Even after all that, I got lots of errors, and the -ldes link step
(obviously) failed; but the database did get fully built and seems to work.
I should perhaps try to run Lackwit on a (much) simpler example.

To find the variables that share types with a given variable, do
"searchlocal procname:varname", eg "searchlocal real_count:start".

BUGS already reported:

When I issue the "counts" command to BackEnd (processing the lislook
example database), I get a segmentation fault, even if "counts" is the
first command I enter.

I was confused by messages like this:
  Enter your command ('help' for help): searchlocal f_empty:a
  Expression is not a pointer
which you explained meant that a's type is an unconstrained type variable.
I thought it had something to do with the type of variable "a" in the
underlying program -- "int" rather than "int*".  I don't even know what
"pointer" means in this context, since I think it doesn't have to do with
whether the variable is a pointer (I can produce that message for both
"int" and "int*" variables).  It would be helpful to users if you made the
message a bit more explicit.

[For foo.c, described in my mail of Fri, 9 Apr 1999 10:18:52:]
Enter your command ('help' for help): searchlocal f:*a
../../src/globalInf/cTypeTable.c:1238: failed assertion `0 <= componentNum && componentNum < getCTypeArity(t)'
Abort

Please add a flag to searchlocal to report all hits, even if no operator is
involved.
