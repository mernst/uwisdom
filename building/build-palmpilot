From http://howto.pilot-link.org/ppp/ca.html:
To test the serial port with the Palm:
  apt -yqq install statserial
  # Cradle your palm
  # From a terminal, not under Emacs:
  statserial /dev/ttyS0
  # Both "Clear To Send" (CTS) and "Data Set Ready" (DSR) should go high
  # (from 0 to 1); if not, the serial port is misconfigured. Check the BIOS
  # settings, dmesg, and setserial on the port proper.
  setserial -g /dev/ttyS[0-3]
