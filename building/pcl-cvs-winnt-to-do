Hi...

I have some information for your FAQ. Some people need the pcl-cvs (cvs within emacs)
package, but it didn't work for NT.

Ok here the solution:

	- Get the current version of pcl-cvs (1.9)
	- Edit the pcl-cvs.el
		- Search for >"-m" msg< and replace it to
		  >"-m" (concat "\"" msg "\"")<

That's all - Now you can update, commit, add (tested) and i hope everthing else will work
as well...

I can also send you the changed version ?! Here the changes for the _emacs:

;; ======== CVS ========
 ;; (setq cvs-auto-remove-handled t)
 (setq cvs-program "c:\\tools\\cvs.exe")
 (setq cvs-diff-program "c:\\tools\\diff.exe")
 (setq cvs-rmdir-program "c:\\tools\\rm.exe")
 (setq cvs-shell "C:\\WINDOWS\\system32\\cmd.exe")

As far as other programs, you'll need a Unix-like shell, a diff program, and
a remove directory program.  I use `tcsh' as the shell, GNU diff, and GNU
`rm'.  These are available in various places on the Internet, most notably
in the Cygnus package and RkTools package.

To use `pcl-cvs' on Windows, all one needs to do is define a couple of
variables prior to loading the package since it needs to know where to find
the programs described above.  I have something equivalent to the following
in my .emacs:

     (defvar cvs-program "c:/TcTools/cvs.exe"
       "*Full path to the cvs executable.")

     ;; SunOS-4.1.1_U1 has "diff.c 1.12 88/08/04 SMI; from UCB 4.6 86/04/03"
     ;;
     (defvar cvs-diff-program "c:/TcTools/diff.exe"
       "*Full path to the best diff program you've got.
NOTE:  there are some nasty bugs in the context diff variants of some vendor
versions, such as the one in SunOS-4.1.1_U1")

     (defvar cvs-rmdir-program "c:/TcTools/rm -fr"
       "*Full path to the rmdir program.  Typically /bin/rmdir.")

     (defvar cvs-shell (cond
                        ((getenv "ESHELL")
                         (getenv "ESHELL"))
                        (t
                         "c:/TcTools/sh.exe"))
       "*Full path to a shell that can do redirection on stdout.")
