===========================================================================

mailman is installed by default on Red Hat 7.3.

===========================================================================

# Version 2.1b4 was released on 26-Oct-2002; it requires Python 2.1.3 or 2.2.1.
# So version 2.1 should be coming soon.

# Do all this on geyer.
cd ~/tmp
wget http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/mailman/mailman-2.0.13.tgz
tar xvfz mailman-2.0.13.tgz
cd mailman-2.0.13

# As root:
mv /home/mailman /home/mailman-VER
userdel mailman
(cd /var/yp; make)
useradd -d /home/mailman -u 60 -g mailman mailman
set prefix=/home/mailman
  cd $prefix
  chgrp mailman .
  chmod a+rx,g+ws .
setenv MAILHOST pag.lcs.mit.edu
setenv WWWHOST pag.lcs.mit.edu
# I looked up --with-mail-gid value in /etc/sendmail.cf
./configure --with-mail-gid=12
make install
# This failed (and passing  --[old]includedir=/usr/i386-glibc20-linux/ to
# ./configure didn't help), so I ended up doing
#   (query-replace "-I. " "-I. -I/usr/i386-glibc20-linux/include " nil)
# to src/Makefile, and that seemed to work.

# Check the installation
cd $prefix
bin/check_perms
# If problems above, run "bin/check_perms -f" until no problems.

... lots of other painful stuff here.

Send initial announcement message:

To: daikon-announce@pag.lcs.mit.edu

Subject: New mailing lists: daikon-announce, daikon-discuss
Reply-to: mernst@lcs.mit.edu

In response to several requests, I have created two new mailing lists
(see http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/) for the Daikon invariant
detector (http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/daikon/):

  daikon-announce@pag.lcs.mit.edu is for announcements regarding the Daikon
      invariant detector, such as when a new version is released.  This
      list is low-volume -- one or two messages per month.

  daikon-discuss@pag.lcs.mit.edu is a forum for discussion among Daikon
      users.  Use it to share tips and successes, and to get help with
      questions or problems (after checking the documentation).  Only list
      members may post to the list.

If you are receiving this message, you are subscribed to daikon-announce,
because at some point you asked me to inform you of future updates.  If you
wish to unsubscribe, then either go to
http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/daikon-announce (use the "Edit
Options" button at the bottom of the page to retrieve your password), or
send mail to daikon-announce-request@pag.lcs.mit.edu, or send mail to me.

If you wish to subscribe to the daikon-discuss list, then go to
http://pag.lcs.mit.edu/mailman/listinfo/daikon-discuss and enter your
email address in the form.
