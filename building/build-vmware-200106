OLDER NOTES (June 2001)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I can only create a 2047-MB virtual machine.  But it only has to contain
the operating system; I can keep all data on the host and do networking.
Do not install to raw disk; OSes keep caches and do partial writes, so this
would lead to inconsistencies and data loss.
Or maybe I shouldn't worry about this at all and should dual-boot
or have a separate computer instead.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation on PC:
 * Answer questions:
    * no networking
    * disable CD autorun
 * Enable host-only networking
    * subnet = 172.16.198
 * Use configuration editor to add floppy later; this must be done with the
   floppy in the bay.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Installation on Linux:

Download from http://www.vmware.com/download/downloadlinux.html

http://www.vmware.com/support/linux/doc/install_config_linux.html

# Run this on the machine with the peripherals attached, not on a server.
## This "rpm" command segfaulted on meoptiplex, 12/4/2000.
## Instead, try from the tar file
## rpm -Uhv bin/src/vmware/VMware-2.0.3-799.i386.rpm
# Do this not as root
cd ~mernst/bin/src/vmware
tar zxf VMware-2.0.3-799.tar.gz
su
cd ~mernst/bin/src/vmware
cd vmware-distrib 
./vmware-install.pl

This failed, too, with the following output:

  [root@meoptiplex vmware-distrib]# ./vmware-install.pl
  A previous installation of VMware has been detected.

  The previous installation was made by the rpm installer (version 2).

  Converting the rpm2 installer database format
	  to the tar2 installer database format.

  error: package VMware is not installed
  Failure

  Execution aborted.

  [root@meoptiplex vmware-distrib]# 

Idea:  comment out perl script check of rpm database

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can add more usernames at any time by invoking the following command as 
root: "/usr/bin/vmware-smbpasswd vmnet1 -a <username>"

Put the license file in ~/.vmware/license

# run it; this must be on the local machine if I want to use the CD-ROM
vmware


I didn't do this; maybe I should have:
  This system appears to have a CIFS/SMB server (Samba) configured for
  normal use.  If this server is intended to run, you need to make sure
  that it will not conflict with the Samba server setup on the private
  network (the one that we use to share the host filesystem). Please check
  your /etc/smb.conf file so that:
  . The "interfaces" line does not contain "172.16.170.1/255.255.255.0"
  . There is a "socket address" line that contains only your real host IP
    address

===========================================================================

(Some of this is probably subsumed by the above.)

VMware installation notes:

At www.crs.lcs.mit.edu, create new DNS data for my VMware machine.

Menu Devices >> Connect
At one time, only host system or only guest system can use device; this
menu decides which.
Put boot device on /dev/fd0
Edit floppy settings, use image instead of device.
Installing debian:  use rescue floppy first, then use root floppy.
(Section 5.4 of installation instruction has boot floppies.  Also a program
to write them from DOS.)

Settings >> Autofit

Windows Network & Dialup Connections:  assume #2 is local (guess & check).
Get a DNS.

Use "compact" rescue/root boot floppies; non-compact crashed VMware,
because the non-compact versions used weird drivers.

===========================================================================

Samba:

For a linux host, run the vmware-config.pl script; it is supposed to set up
the samba server right.

On the linux client, mount a share from a windows host by doing something
(as root) along the lines of this:
  mount -t smbfs //windowshostname/sharename  /mnt/somewhere -o user=windowsUserName 
after which if all goes well it'll ask for a password and mount it.  

If you have a remote NFS share which you keep a lot of stuff on anyway you
might also want to consider using that.
