## Install in a VIRTUAL MACHINE.
## Do not install directly in the main operating system.
## Determine version number from
## https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en#downloads

# First, go to ~/wisdom/building/build-vmware
# In the VM:
#  * sudo apt install gnome-panel
#    then log out and back in, selecting Gnome Flashback (Metacity) as your desktop (Metacity is faster than Compiz)
#  * VMware tools may already be installed; to test run
#      initctl list | grep vmw
#    Possibly can also run
#     sudo /usr/bin/vmware-toolbox
#    ?
#    To reinstall: mount the virtual CD drive in the guest, uncompress the installer, and run
#    sudo vmware-tools-distrib/vmware-install.pl
#  * Chrome browser (via Firefox)
#  * sudo apt install vlc

===========================================================================

There is a repository for Ubuntu that I can use.
It is only given for LTS versions of Ubuntu:  Trusty Tahr 14.04, Xenial Xerus 16.04, etc.
Get instructions from:
https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian

Does this install Tor Browser?  It's not clear that it does, but I
should check by running
  hash -r
  tor-bro<TAB>
to see if an executable named tor-browser* exists.

===========================================================================

## The instructions at
## https://www.torproject.org/docs/debian.html.en
## are for Tor itself and are not necessary for the Tor browser, I believe.
## So, I needn't run those instructions.

# Get version number at https://dist.torproject.org/torbrowser/
# or https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en
