*****
I should install the Java JDK before Cygwin.
*****

Install Cygwin64.
 * Disable virus protection
 * Obtain setup program from https://www.cygwin.com/setup-x86_64.exe
 * Run the setup program
 * Install into c:\cygwin64  [the default]
 * Put local packages in c:\Program Files\cygwin-local-packages
   (Don't do this for Cat's computer, though.)
 * Start out with a base installation:  install nothing extra
 * Run cmd.exe, then within it run:
    Desktop\setup-x86_64.exe -q -P wget,tar,qawk,bzip2,subversion,unzip,zip,automake,cvs,gcc-core,gcc-g++,git,make,mercurial,patch,subversion,emacs,emacs-el,m4,python3,libiconv,ca-certificates,curl,texlive-collection-latex,texlive-collection-latex-doc,texlive-collection-latexextra,texlive-collection-latexextra-doc,texlive-collection-latexrecommended,texlive-collection-latexrecommended-doc,xterm,w3m,wget,diffutils,dos2unix,ncurses,patchutils,time,unison2.48,w3m
I need to install gradle manually, it seems.

[Older; maybe integrate into the above.
 * At the "Select Packages" window, add:
    Editors: as an experiment, on X61s emacs-w32 but not emacs-x11
    Editors: usually also emacs-x11
    X11: (all)
      [It's possible, but tedious, to isolate the parts I really need in order to run Emacs; it's easier just to install all of the X11 packages.]
      [When Emacs segmentation-faulted, reinstalling all of X11 fixed the problem once; another time I needed a full Cygwin reinstall.]
    [I might later expand this list...]
 * Wait for a long time while the installation proceeds.
   * I had problems with the download hanging when I used the gatech site
]

Re-enable virus protection

[If I didn't use "mernst" as my Windows username, then probably everything
is messed up, but I could try the following even though it's probably futile:
Use Wordpad to edit /etc/passwd, changing my user name and home directory
from "Michael Ernst" to "mernst".]


Add XWin server (or Cygwin bash shell) to start menu:
  Copy (not Right-drag) it there from the Start Menu (it's in "All Programs > Cygwin-X"), OR In start menu, right-click on cygwin xterm and then do "pin to start menu".  Don't put it on the desktop.
  Rename it to "xterm".
  The terminal window starts really small; I should see about fixing that.
Add XLaunch to the desktop.  It's for use if xterm doesn't work.  XLaunch does
  work, but requires going through multple screens rather than just clicking
  on the icon.
Not needed: cygwin terminal, xterm

Test that openssh was downloaded:
     ssh mernst@godwit.cs.washington.edu

[Is this necessary any more?]
# Run C:\cygwin\bin\ash.exe from Windows Command Shell:
export TEMP=/tmp
export TMP=/tmp
/bin/rebaseall

Follow the directions in ~/wisdom/setup/setup-linux-account

Make symbolic link to ~mernst and to ~mernst/sync (they are at C:\cygwin64) from Desktop.
It's critical to make the shortcut in place (via right-click in Windows
Explorer), then move it afterward.

Install hunspell:  ~/wisdom/building/build-hunspell

===========================================================================

For unistallation instructions (if I need to do a complete reinstall), see
  http://cygwin.com/faq/faq.html#faq.setup.uninstall-all
However, do not delete the entire Cygwin directory.  First synchronize with
Unison, and then move my home directory aside and put it back after the
install.  The reason is that an initial synchronization with Unison takes a
very long time.

===========================================================================

[I didn't get this to work.]

Kerberos:
  http://www-cdf.fnal.gov/~cplager/kerberos.html#cygwin
That didn't work for me; the downloaded kinit application segfaulted:
  mernst@MDEX300 ~
  $ kinit
  Password for mernst@CSAIL.MIT.EDU:
	6 [main] kinit 4468 _cygtls::handle_exceptions: Error while dumping state
  (probably corrupted stack)
  Segmentation fault (core dumped)

Windows shares are available as /cygdrive/e for E:, etc.
