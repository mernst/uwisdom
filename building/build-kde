This is actually about using KDE.  I gave up, again (2/17/2006).
My problems were with the window manager.


Can I use another window (such as sawfish or, better, metacity) with KDE?

See "The K Window Manager Handbook"
But I can't find that anywhere.  (Maybe it isn't installed via Debian?)
Themes:
  http://kde.themes.org/  http://www.kde-look.org
KDE Control Center and select Regional & Accessibility->Keyboard Shortcuts

Background: no picture
Colors: single color

Control Center >> Appearance and Themes >> Window Decorations	
Halfway reasonable window decorations:
 Glow
 Redmond
 KStep (not as good)

I can't figure out how to make Alt-TAB not require an extra keystroke.
This is driving me nuts.  May be an X problem.  Try "xev"?

Another serious problem is that KDE steals some keystrokes from Emacs.

And focus doesn't follow the mouse, which I also don't like.
