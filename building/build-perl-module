On Debian, often there is a pre-existing package; just do something like
  apt install libcrypt-ssleay-perl
This is better because when perl is updated, they won't break or need to
be reinstalled.
However, those packages should be listed not here, but in file
  ~mernst/wisdom/setup/setup-debian-pkgs.needed-laptop

===========================================================================

When there is a CSE operating system upgrade, delete ~/.cpan and start over installing CPAN packages.
Also probably ~/perl5

===========================================================================

To install CPAN modules (these are the ones I seem to need):
(On my own machine, run all these with `sudo`.)

cpan App::cpanminus
cpanm CSS::DOM
cpanm Bundle::LWP
cpanm List::MoreUtils

# These are needed for createcal
sudo cpanm Date::Manip
sudo cpanm Date::Calc
sudo cpanm HTML::Strip
sudo cpanm Date::ICal
sudo cpanm HTML::TableExtract
sudo cpanm DateTime::Format::DateParse
sudo cpanm JSON::Parse

===========================================================================

OLDER:

To use Perl CPAN quickinstall
(http://theoryx5.uwinnipeg.ca/auto/install.html):
 * As root:
     perl -MCPAN -e shell
 * Copy the cpan-install module to ~/bin/share/ and make it executable)
 * On Unix, under Edit -> Preferences -> Navigator -> Applications in
   Netscape, create a new helper application for MIME Type
   application/x-cpan. Under Handled By, select Application and choose
   /path/to/xterm -e /path/to/cpan-install %s. The program xterm is that
   used to call up a terminal window - you may have to provide some further
   options to this, or you may want to use another program. With this
   configuration, Netscape will launch an xterm window and run the relevant
   script to install the package when a quickinstall link from CPAN Search
   is selected.

First, setup:
(When running this command, be sure that the gcc version is the same as
that used when compiling Perl.)
  perl -MCPAN -e shell
If as root, take defaults, and done with setup.
If not as root, make the below choices.
You need to set (this comes after about 35 questions for which you select
the default):
  Parameters for the 'perl Makefile.PL' command? []
  PREFIX=/homes/gws/mernst/bin/src/perl
  Parameters for the 'make install' command? []
  INSTALLMAN3DIR=/homes/gws/mernst/bin/src/perl/lib/perl5/man/man3
  Parameters for the 'perl Build.PL' command? []
  --install_base /homes/gws/mernst/bin/src/perl
Instead of the above, you can take all defaults and then apply this patch:
diff -u ~/.cpan-save2/CPAN/MyConfig.pm ~/.cpan/CPAN/MyConfig.pm

Now, actual installation:
  perl -MCPAN -e shell
Do NOT attempt to do
  install CPAN
  reload CPAN
which does not work for me, even though the program suggests it.
Then, do these:  either all on one "install" line separated by spaces, or ONE-BY-ONE (because some ask questions):
  install Bundle::CPAN
# Instead of Bundle::LWP, on Ubuntu just do: sudo apt install libwww-perl
  install Bundle::LWP
## Instead of CSS::DOM, on Ubuntu just do: sudo apt install libcss-dom-perl
  install CSS::DOM
# I am delaying re-installing the below until I know what each is for.
  install LWP::Protocol::https
  install Bundle::libnet
  install Config::General
  install Crypt::SSLeay
  install Date::Manip
  install Devel::Symdump
  install Digest::MD5
  install DB_File
  install Getopt::Tabular
  install HTML::Parser
  install HTML::Tree
  install List::Util
  install MIME::Base64
  install MIME::Parser
  install Mail::Audit
  install MailTool
  install Net::DNS
  install Net::FTP
  install Net::IP
  install Term::ReadKey
  install Text::BibTeX
  install Text::CSV
  install Text::CSV_XS
  install Time::HiRes
  install WWW::Link
To search for a package:
  i /regexp/

10/27/2008:  Failure for
  install Mail::SpamAssassin

===========================================================================

Notes on specific modules:

Bundle::LWP is libwww-perl

===========================================================================

To build a perl module by hand:

 # If no root permissions, then:
 # perl Makefile.PL PREFIX=$HOME/bin/src/perl
 perl Makefile.PL
 make
 make test
 make install

It's really that simple!


If a test (say, "op lfs.t") fails, do
  perl t/op/lfs.t
