Make a Debian package for the Checker Framework, with a javacheck alias.  Maybe start with Daikon, to warm up.
Create a Debian package first; get a sponsor; and get it into Debian.

make an Ubuntu package: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SyncRequestProcess .)
Use the dh packaging helper, and the 3.0 (quilt) format
Do this setup:

Use dh rather than debhelper.
pbuilder: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PbuilderHowto

Tuturial slides; is useful (see especially slides 15ff):
  https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/packaging-tutorial/packaging-tutorial.en.pdf

  (slide 60 is packaging a Java library; answers are later in the slide deck)
