make

 Once only:
 su
 mkdir /usr/local/etc/htdig
 mkdir /usr/local/etc/htdig-customize
 chgrp cf-web /usr/local/etc/htdig*
 chmod g+w /usr/local/etc/htdig*
 exit
]

make install

Edit /usr/local/etc/htdig/conf/htdig.conf

/usr/local/etc/htdig/bin/rundig
# I need to use -a to permit searching while re-indexing, probably.

After the installation, you will be ready to test out everything. You can use the rundig script to make a test database of the online
documentation at http://www.htdig.org/ 

The only thing left to do is to modify the htdig.conf config file which was placed in CONFIG_DIR/htdig.conf. The Configuration manual
has the details on how what attributes are needed. 

===========================================================================

This has problems with directory URLs that lack the trailing /, so
I had to edit (for instance) /www/cystic-l/search-blank.html accordingly.
(I did "find . -type d" to find the directories.)


For index pages (like those in Cystic-L monthly archives), add 
<meta robots=noindex> or some such.

Should double-check that the daily archives aren't appearing.
