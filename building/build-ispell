Ispell 3.1:

http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html

----------------

* The first time, I had to create /usr/dict (linking it on all systems to
/usr/local/dict).

* Add to local.h:

#define __STDC__

* Next time, make the columns line up (see local.h to find out how).

* Maybe add to local.h (but these might not be necessary):

#define USG		/* Define this on System V */
#define GENERATE_LIBRARY_PROTOS

* Run make

* Run doit make install

* As root, move man pages from /usr/local/man[14] to /usr/catman/local
  via M-m in Emacs.

----------------

To patch:

patch -p0 < patchname
make dictclean
make             # Actually, this failed and I had to do "make clean; make".
doit make install

I also had to remove an old man page.
