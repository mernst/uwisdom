Kythe is the open-source version of Google's Grok tool.
It could replace, for example, etags.
However, there is no Emacs integration that I could find via a web search in 2016.

An alternative is srclib.

cd ~/bin/install
wget https://github.com/google/kythe/releases/download/v0.0.26/kythe-v0.0.26.tar.gz
tar xzf kythe-v*.tar.gz
