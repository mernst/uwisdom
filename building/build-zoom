# I'm not sure this worked!  Maybe I need to reboot too??
On Ubuntu:
# Download from https://zoom.us/support/down4j .
sudo dpkg -i ~/tmp/zoom_amd64.deb

OLDER:
Don't try to install on Ubuntu.
Just run it from the browser.
I can't get sound to work (I can't hear them, though they can hear me).
And I don't trust it not to corrupt my system.
