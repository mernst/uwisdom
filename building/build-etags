Don't forget to supply -DETAGS_REGEXP switch to compiler.
Also -DSTDC_HEADERS.
Maybe also -DDEBUG=1

On Suns, the solution is to use the very old regex-0.12 package rather than
the newer rx-1.5 package.  These are in /uns/lib and /uns/include on Solaris.

On Suns, I tried copying /usr/include/getopt.h from a Linux machine to get
etags.c to compile; then also include -I to tell [g]cc where to find it;
but then I got a linker error about _getopt_long being undefined.

===========================================================================

In the Emacs source, to just build etags, I did:

 ./configure
 make lib-src/etags

which resulted (for Emacs 20.3.7) in line

gcc -g -O   -L/usr/local/X11R6.1/lib  lib-src/etags.c   -o lib-src/etags

but I really want to add flags

-DSTDC_HEADERS -DETAGS_REGEXPS

and the latter still gives Solaris fits.

Even then, I'm still having problems because re_registers and other types
aren't defined.

So rename
  <regex.h>
to
  <regex.h.old>

But now I can't find /uns/lib/libregex.a
