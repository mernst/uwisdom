I didn't do our MediaWiki configuration personally -- Michael Bolin did 
it.  But from what he told me, and looking at the INSTALL file in the 
MediaWiki dist, here's what you have to do:

1. Unpack the MediaWiki distribution into a web-accessible directory

2. Make sure its "config" subdirectory is writable by the web server (fs 
sa www.pink-panther.csail.mit.edu write)

3. Browse to the MediaWiki distribution's directory through the CSAIL 
web server.  It'll redirect you to the config subdirectory, and then 
it's just a matter of filling out web forms to create LocalSettings.php.

4. Move LocalSettings.php from the config subdir up to the main 
directory of the wiki distribution, and delete the world-writable config 
directory.
