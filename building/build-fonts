Ubuntu:
sudo apt -qqy install fonts-inconsolata fonts-hack

----------------

Or: copy .ttf files to /usr/local/share/fonts and run:
sudo fc-cache -fv


===========================================================================

# Older:
# sudo apt -yqq install ttf-inconsolata
# sudo fc-cache -fv


Inconsolata is better to get from:
https://fonts.google.com/selection

Windows:
Click on http://levien.com/type/myfonts/Inconsolata.otf and then click on "install".


Cygwin:
???
(Being installed in Windows doesn't seem to be enough for Emacs to recognize it.)

;; This doesn't look as good to me:
;; (And under Cygwin it's proportional spacing!  At least without installing more...)
;; (set-face-attribute 'default nil :height 115 :family "Consolas")


Older:

Put Inconsolata.otf in ~/.fonts/ :
cd ~/.fonts
wget http://levien.com/type/myfonts/Inconsolata.otf

This seems to be necessary in the account that is running the X client
process (where the program is running) -- it doesn't help that it is
installed in the account that is running the X server (the machine at which
I am sitting).
