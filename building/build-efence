Electric Fence (efence) is distributed with (some versions of?) Linux.

ftp://ftp.perens.com/pub/ElectricFence/

Electric Fence is a different kind of malloc() debugger. It uses the virtual
memory hardware of your system to detect when software overruns the boundaries
of a malloc() buffer. It will also detect any accesses of memory that has
been released by free(). Because it uses the VM hardware for detection,
Electric Fence stops your program on the first instruction that causes
a bounds violation. It's then trivial to use a debugger to display the
offending statement.

Just add "-lefence" to the link line.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR DEBUGGING YOUR PROGRAM
       1.     Link with libefence.a as explained above.
       2.     Run your program in a debugger and fix any overruns
              or accesses to free memory.
       3.     Quit the debugger.
       4.     Set EF_PROTECT_BELOW = 1 in the shell  environment.
       5.     Repeat  step  2,  this  time repairing underruns if
              they occur.
       6.     Quit the debugger.
       7.     Read the restrictions in the section on WORD-ALIGN­
              MENT  AND  OVERRUN  DETECTION.   See if you can set
              EF_ALIGNMENT to 0 and repeat step 2. Sometimes this
              will  be  too  much work, or there will be problems
              with library routines for which you don't have  the
              source, that will prevent you from doing this.
