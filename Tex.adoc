[[figures-floats]]
Figures (floats)
----------------

In LaTeX, always put a in front of a in a

In LaTeX, to get a line between floats (figures, tables, etc.) and text,
do something like (these must take up zero vertical space):

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
 % Add line between figure and text
 \makeatletter
 \def\topfigrule{\kern3\p@ \hrule \kern -3.4\p@} % the \hrule is .4pt high
 \def\botfigrule{\kern-3\p@ \hrule \kern 2.6\p@} % the \hrule is .4pt high
 \def\dblfigrule{\kern3\p@ \hrule \kern -3.4\p@} % the \hrule is .4pt high
 \makeatother
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In ACM styles that add a line between the figure and the caption,
additionally do

---------------
 \nocaptionrule
---------------

Once you have the line, you can consider reducing `\floatsep`:

----------------------------------------------------
 % Reduce space between figures and text
 \addtolength{\textfloatsep}{-.5\textfloatsep}
 \addtolength{\dbltextfloatsep}{-.5\dbltextfloatsep}
 % Optional
 \addtolength{\floatsep}{-.5\floatsep}
 \addtolength{\dblfloatsep}{-.5\dblfloatsep}
----------------------------------------------------

 To prevent having just a couple of figures, and lots of white space, on
a page produced by LaTeX, do the following. Also consider making it 90%.

----------------------------------------------------------------
 % At least 80% of every float page must be taken up by
 % floats; there will be no page with more than 20% white space.
 \def\topfraction{.8}
 \def\dbltopfraction{\topfraction}
 \def\floatpagefraction{\topfraction}     % default .5
 \def\dblfloatpagefraction{\topfraction}  % default .5
 \def\textfraction{.2}
----------------------------------------------------------------

To fix "too many unprocessed floats" error, do one of the following: *
spread your figures further apart in your document, or * put in a or
command to allow a page full of figures to be generated.

The change in font size of a LaTeX figure caption won't take unless you
give an empty optional argument, like so:

------------------------------------
  \caption[]{{\small Small caption}}
------------------------------------

But, I think that does not adjust the inter-line spacing in the caption,
so don't use that approach.

To get inter-line spacing right in LaTeX figure captions that are set
smaller than body text: In the paper, do

-------------------------------------
  \renewcommand{\captionfont}{\small}
-------------------------------------

or

----------------------------------------
  \renewcommand{\captionfont}{\small\bf}
----------------------------------------

and use the following definition of :

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\newcommand{\captionfont}{\bf}
\long\def\@makecaption#1#2{
   \vskip \baselineskip
   \setbox\@tempboxa\hbox{\captionfont{#1: #2\strut}}
   \ifdim \wd\@tempboxa >\hsize % IF longer than one line:
       {\captionfont\noindent\parbox{\hsize}{#1: #2\strut}}\par     %   THEN set as ordinary paragraph.
     \else                      %   ELSE  center.
       \hbox to\hsize{\hfil\box\@tempboxa\hfil}
   \fi}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

'''''

[[tables]]
Tables
------

To reduce intercolumn space in tables:

-----------------------------------------
  \addtolength{\tabcolsep}{-.5\tabcolsep}
  \setlength{\tabcolsep}{0pt}
-----------------------------------------

Aligning decimal points (periods) in tables in TeX/LaTeX: use dcolumn
package (described in the LaTeX Companion). In particular:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \usepackage{dcolumn}
  % dcolumn customization
  \newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{.}{#1}} % argument is number of decimal places
  \newcolumntype{.}{d{1}} % "1" means one digit after the decimal point
  \newcolumntype{.}{d{-1}} % "-1" means center the decimal point in the column; ugly
  \newcolumntype{.}{d{0}} % "0" means decimal point is right-justified, not so different from right-justifying the column
  \newcolumntype{.}{d{5.1} % 5 places to the left of the decimal, one to the right
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

and then use "." as a column separator, much like "c". These column
separators do not check the number of decimal points in the table
itself. Thus, using a value other than -1 can leave additional space at
the right side of the column, or let extra digits after the decimal
point lap into the next column.

To put a footnote within a table in LaTeX, surround the table with a
minipage:

-----------------------------------------
  \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
  1 & 2 & 3\footnote{Nothing important}\\
  4 & 5 & 6
  \end{tabular}
  \end{minipage}
-----------------------------------------

To make entries in a LaTeX "tabular" table that span multiple columns,
as with the HTML "colspan" attribute, use an entry like

---------------------------
   \multicolumn{3}{l}{text}
---------------------------

where 3 is the number of columns to span, and "l" is the alignment of
the spanning contents. seems to want to insert inter-column spacing
around the contents even if you've tried to disable it in the header
line with @\{} (or @\{your amount of space}), but you can override it by
putting a negative version of the space on the *inside* of the
multicolumn, as in:

-------------------------------------------
   \multicolumn{3}{l}{\hskip-\tabcolsep...}
-------------------------------------------

To span multiple rows (as with the HTML "rowspan" attribute), use :

-------------------------------------------------
  \usepackage{multirow}
  \multirow{nrows}[bigstruts]{width}[fixup]{text}
-------------------------------------------------

Multirow documentation is at
http://mirror.math.ku.edu/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/multirow/multirow.sty
The width is a size like "25mm" or `"*"` for "vertically centered". The
rows that donâ€™t contain the "multi-row" specification must have empty
cells where the multi-row is going to appear. requires use of the
multirow package: You can nest in but not vice versa.

'''''

[[displays]]
Displays
--------

To intersperse left-justified text with aligned equations, use the TeX
primitive. For example,

-----------------------
  \begin{eqnarray}
  test & 1 & 2 \\
  \noalign{\hbox{left}}
  test & 3 & 4
  \end{eqnarray}
-----------------------

produces results like the following:

--------------------------------
            test  1  2       (1)
  left
            test  3  4       (2)
--------------------------------

Use

---------------------------------
  \setlength{\arraycolsep}{.25em}
---------------------------------

to reduce/compress the horizontal spaces (as around equal signs) between
columns in a LaTeX array or eqnarray environment. Use

--------------------------------------
  \setlength{\tabcolsep}{.5\tabcolsep}
--------------------------------------

to reduce the width of columns in a table or tabular environment.

'''''

[[lists]]
Lists
-----

To eliminate LaTeX list/itemize/enumerate spacing between items: 1. From
one list:

-----------------------------
    \begin{itemize}
    \itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt
    ...
    \end{itemize}
-----------------------------

____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
(Since the default values for and are set in a somewhat roundabout way,
putting "" in the preamble doesn't work.) 2. From all lists:
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    %% Bring items closer together in list environments
    %% This doesn't work with an optional argument to the list environment.
    % Prevent infinite loops
    \let\Itemize =\itemize    
    \let\Enumerate =\enumerate
    \let\Description =\description
    % Zero the vertical spacing parameters
    \def\Nospacing{\itemsep=0pt\topsep=0pt\partopsep=0pt\parskip=0pt\parsep=0pt}
    % Redefine the environments in terms of the original values
    \renewenvironment{itemize}{\Itemize\Nospacing}{\endlist}
    \renewenvironment{enumerate}{\Enumerate\Nospacing}{\endlist}
    \renewenvironment{description}{\Description\Nospacing}{\endlist}
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
--
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________
This doesn't work with an optional argument to the list environment,
however; if you do, for example,
_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

--------------------------------
    \begin{enumerate}[$\bullet$]
--------------------------------

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

--
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

-----------------------------
    \itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt

some places (e.g., it > overlaps the list and the following paragraph),
so isn't worth the hassle. > tweaklist

To control pre-list space, set (or insert an explicit negative (not )).
(I had to give an explicit argument, not -etc.; but
`\vspace*{-\partopsep}` worked for me if it came after the
PARAGRAPH GOES HERE. \begin\{enumerate}

  \setcounter{saveenumi}{\theenumi}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{\thesaveenumi}
  \item ...
  ...
\end{enumerate}

-------------------------------------------------------------------

environment does:
-------------------------------------------------------------------

% Arguments are left and right margins #1#2\{} =
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


---------------------------------------------------------------------------
=Defining macros=

Here are ways to test wither a macro argument is empty/null:
 1. The following macro definition will test whether a macro argument is empty:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------------
\def\mymacro#1{%
 \def\tempa{#1}\ifx\tempa\empty{then-part}\else{else-part}\fi
 }%
-------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------
    Note that PLAIN.TEX defines \empty as follows:
--------------------------------------------------

-------------
\def\empty{}%
-------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    LaTeX defines \@empty in a similar way, if you want to work with .sty files.
    Note that since this uses \def to assign the value of #2 to a macro, it
    won't work in TeX's mouth, and needs the stomach as well (so it won't work
    inside an \edef for example).
 2. This way of testing for null arguments can be done entirely in TeX's mouth:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \def\showempty#1{\message{\ifx\relax#1\relax empty\else not empty\fi}}
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------
    It does however fail badly if #1 begins with \relax 
    (e.g., \showempty{\relax...}).
 3. Another way of testing for empty arguments in TeX's mouth is to say:
------------------------------------------------------------------------

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
   \ifx\unlikely#2\unlikely ...true text... \else ...false text ... \fi
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    This will expand to `true text' iff #2 is empty, or begins with
    \unlikely.  So if you make \unlikely an unlikely macro for #2 to begin
    with, then you're away.  (It also dies if #2 contains unbalanced \if,
    \else or \fi's, but that should be pretty rare.  Touch wood.)

LaTeX macros gobble space after them.  If you wish to insert space
(except before punctuation or other places where it shouldn't be
inserted) after a macro expansion, then add "\xspace" at the end of the
macro body.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 ... ... ... and we find available to us ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a LaTeX command that typesets its argument in a smaller \tt font.  It
permits line breaks at spaces within the argument (but not within words),
respects current series (such as boldface), and works in both horizontal (text)
and math mode.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1]\{\ifmmode\{\mbox\{

----------------------------------------------
Here's a version that takes care of URLs, too:
----------------------------------------------

 %HEVEA [1]\{\ifmmode\{\mbox\{ [1]\{\{\url\{#1`%HEVEA \def\myurl{\url}`
Similarly, "

Use (or, simpler, |...|), not latexmath:[$...$], to typeset a
multi-character identifier in LaTeX math mode. latexmath:[$...$] puts
incorrect kerning between the letters. (It looks bad, and enough people
will notice that it is worthwhile to get the typesetting right.)

 % Can't unindent the LaTeX comments or the doc program will respect
those % comments. That's unfortunate, because I typically unindent when
inserting % in a LaTeX document.

Here are definitions for identifiers in LaTeX math mode formulas:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  % \|name| or \mathid{name} denotes identifiers and slots in formulas
  \def\|#1|{\mathid{#1}}
  \newcommand{\mathid}[1]{\ensuremath{\mathit{#1```
  % \<name> or \codeid{name} denotes computer code identifiers
  \def\<#1>{\codeid{#1}}
  \protected\def\codeid#1{\ifmmode{\mbox{\ttfamily{#1```\else{\ttfamily #1}\fi}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This alternate definition of `\codeid` does not work inside an array
environments (see http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/27592/ ):

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \newcommand{\codeid}[1]{\ifmmode{\mbox{\ttfamily{#1```\else{\ttfamily #1}\fi}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To permit hyphenation in tt font globally throughout a document, see
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/44361/how-to-automatically-hyphenate-within-texttt
However, all of those solutions give me a Roman font that differs from
the text font, whereas I want a typewriter font.
`\usepackage[htt]{hyphenat}` doesn't seem to work either.

=Hyphenization; word, line, and page breaking=

raymond@sunkist.berkeley.edu (Raymond Chen) says: To prevent word
breaking (hyphenation) in (La)TeX, =10000 Note, however, that although
it'll work, it ain't exactly the nicest thing to do to your CPU :-)
Reason: TeX will go ahead and hyphenate all the words in your paragraph,
and consider every possible breakpoint (including the hyphens it
inserted), but when it's just about ready to insert a hyphen, it looks
at and say "Whoa! Better not do it here." This is repeated for every
hyphenation point in every word of your paragraph. A much more polite
way to do it is to set the to a number not between 0 and 255; typically,
-1 is used to suppress hyphenation. When the is set to an invalid
number, TeX skips the hyphenation step altogether. So you would say
something like

-------------------------
  \hyphenchar\the\font=-1
-------------------------

to suppress hyphenation for the current font. If you use several fonts,
you'll want to set the for each one. So you would start off like this:

-----------------------
  \hyphenchar\tenrm=-1
  \hyphenchar\ninerm=-1
  ...
-----------------------

You'll probably also want to set =-1 so that any new fonts that get
loaded will also have hyphenation disabled. . Another way is

---------------------
  \pretolerance=10000
---------------------

and, if you get complaints about overfull hboxes, also add

-----------------------
  \emergencystretch=2em
-----------------------

or some bigger value.

piet@cs.ruu.nl (Piet van Oostrum) says: To hyphenate words with imbedded
hyphens, you must disable the hyphenchar while reading the word and
enable it while TeX hyphenates (i.e. at the end of the paragraph). Two
ways to do this:

-----------------------------------------------------
  \def\H#1{\setbox0=\hbox{#1}\unhbox0}
  \showhyphens{subsystem module \H{subsystem-module}}
-----------------------------------------------------

or

------------------------------------------------
  \edef\savehyphenchar{\the\hyphenchar\the\font}
  \hyphenchar\the\font=0
  \showhyphens{subsystem module subsystem-module
  \hyphenchar\the\font=\savehyphenchar} 
------------------------------------------------

To have TeX hyphenate words with imbedded hyphens, you may use the
`breakable hyphen' command: \`\`\`       \def\hyph{-\penalty0\hskip0pt\relax} \`\`\` You could play tricks mapping it to a character that's made active for  the purpose, but`-'?

Another way to permit breaking of hyphenated words:

-----------------------------------------
  \lccode`\-=`\- \hyphenchar\the\font=`\#
-----------------------------------------

and voila, TeX will hyphenate words containing a
`-'. There is only one drawback: if TeX hyphenates a word it uses a`#'
instead of a
`-', as in \`\`\`   \showhyphens{hyphenation} \`\`\` . \`\`\`   Underfull \hbox (badness 10000) detected at line 0   [] \tenrm hy#phen#ation \`\`\` To solve that, the font should contain two hyphen symbols, one in the normal position and one in the position for`#'.

LaTeX doesn't hyphenate automatically when in font because in the
customary uses for fonts, one does not want TeX to insert any hyphens.
Here are two workarounds: 1. Insert explicit "-" wherever you wish to
permit hyphenization. 2. Non-hyphenization is implemented by setting of
the tt fonts to -1. You can undo it by explicitly resetting .

In LaTeX, is a way to do custom hyphenization (without necessarily using
the hyphen character). Use it like

---------------------------------------------------
  \discretionary{beforebreak}{afterbreak}{unbroken}
---------------------------------------------------

Examples:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  \discretionary{-}{}{}              % normal hyphenization; equivalest to: \-
  \discretionary{}{}{}               % no space, but permit break
  \discretionary{}{}{\,}             % thin space, or permit break
  \discretionary{/}{}{/}             % permit break after slash; equivalent to: /\discretionary{}{}{}
  \discretionary{}{.}{.}             % permit break before period (e.g., in URL)
  \discretionary{f-}{fi}{ffi}cult    % kerning
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Redhat 6's (RH6's) LaTeX hyphenation is totally broken because it uses
all the different lanaguages hyphenation rules. fixes the problem by
forcing it to use only English.

To permit more space between words, in order to prevent bad breaks in
narrow columns (like in a newspaper):

-------------------------------------------------------------------
 {\spaceskip = \fontdimen2\the\font
 \advance\spaceskip by 0pt plus 0.5em
 \xspaceskip = \fontdimen7\the\font
 \advance\xspaceskip by 0pt plus 0.5em
 Several features were included in TRACEMAP to make it particularly
 useful for programmers who need to understand the behavior of
 their codes.}
 The most important part is a static pictorial representation of
 .. etc
-------------------------------------------------------------------

This adds an extra 0.5em of stretchability to all spaces, producing big
spaces in the line. This modification is closed as soon as possible by
the } (could probably be earlier) to avoid having strange spacing
further down as a space is better than a hyphenation for TeX ... even
one of these nasty big ones - TeX can't tell the difference. 2is the
space factor of the current font and 0.5em is the extra space factor.

 appears to prevent LaTeX page breaks, even just before lists.

LATEX can break an inline formula only when a relation symbol (=, >,
...) or a binary operation symbol (+, -, ...) exists and at least one of
these symbols appears at the outer level of a formula. Thus
latexmath:[$a+b+c$] can be broken across lines, but
latexmath:[${a+b+c}$] cannot. So, you can wrap parts of your formula in
or the like.

|Do not use math mode (such as latexmath:[$define$]) for italics.
Instead, use or . Math mode does not use ligatures and gets interletter
spacing wrong. . You have improperly used TeX's math mode as a shortcut
for producing words in italic type. This is ugly and distracting.
Instead of saying latexmath:[$START$] (which puts too much space between
"T" and "A"), you should say \{} or, in a formula, or . (There are also
other good ways to get the same output.) This small point will improve
readability and will build confidence that you have been careful
throughout your work.

|Aim to make your figure captions self-explanatory. A short caption
("graph of the results") forces readers to hunt through the text in
order to comprehend your results or your message. Choose to place
explanatory sentences (such as describing the meaning of the rows,
columns, or other elements) in the caption itself; they take up no more
space there, but are easily located either by a careful reader or by
someone flipping through the document. This also makes the figures more
likely to draw readers into the text.

|To adjust section numbering in LaTeX (e.g., make subsubsections be
numbered):

|If a paragraph has only a word or two on its last line, try adding
`\looseness=-1` to the end of it. If possible TeX will change line
breaks to reduce/shorten the length of the paragraph by a line. This
won't always work because there is a limit to how close TeX will move
words. The longer the paragraph, the more likely this trick is
successful.
