// Each entry should contain one of the words "TeX", "LaTeX", "BibTeX", etc.

// PROBLEM with this file is that TeX comments starting in column 1 will be
// ignored by the database searching program!  Therefore, put a space before
// any "%" character that is part of an entry.




== Figures (floats)

In LaTeX, always put a \protect in front of a \ref in a \caption.

In LaTeX, to get a line between floats (figures, tables, etc.) and text, do
something like (these must take up zero vertical space):
```
 % Add line between figure and text
 \makeatletter
 \def\topfigrule{\kern3\p@ \hrule \kern -3.4\p@} % the \hrule is .4pt high
 \def\botfigrule{\kern-3\p@ \hrule \kern 2.6\p@} % the \hrule is .4pt high
 \def\dblfigrule{\kern3\p@ \hrule \kern -3.4\p@} % the \hrule is .4pt high
 \makeatother
 % If there is a line, you can get away with reducing the separation between
 % figures and text.  Don't do this without the line, though.
 \addtolength{\textfloatsep}{-.5\textfloatsep}
 \addtolength{\dbltextfloatsep}{-.5\dbltextfloatsep}
 \addtolength{\floatsep}{-.5\floatsep}
 \addtolength{\dblfloatsep}{-.5\dblfloatsep}
```
In ACM styles that add a line between the figure and the caption,
additionally do
```
 \nocaptionrule
```

// Can't unindent the LaTeX comments or the doc program will respect those
// comments.  That's unfortunate, because I typically unindent when inserting
// in a LaTeX document.
To prevent having just a couple of figures, and lots of white space, on a
page produced by LaTeX, do the following.  Also consider making it 90%.
```
 % At least 80% of every float page must be taken up by
 % floats; there will be no page with more than 20% white space.
 \def\topfraction{.8}
 \def\dbltopfraction{\topfraction}
 \def\floatpagefraction{\topfraction}     % default .5
 \def\dblfloatpagefraction{\topfraction}  % default .5
 \def\textfraction{.2}
```

To fix "too many unprocessed floats" error, do one of the following:
  * spread your figures further apart in your document, or
  * put in a \clearpage or \cleardoublepage command to allow a page full of figures to be generated.

To change the font and line spacing for LaTeX figure captions in acmart.cls (eg, prevent captions from being bold or reduce their font size), do:
```
 % Change font and line spacing for figure captions
 \usepackage{setspace,caption}
 \captionsetup{labelfont={small,bf}, textfont={small,bf,stretch=0.8}, labelsep=colon, margin=0pt}
```

% The change in font size of a LaTeX figure caption won't take unless you give
% `\caption` an empty optional argument, like so:
% ```
%   \caption[]{{\small Small caption}}
% ```
% However, don't use that approach because it does not adjust the inter-line spacing in the caption.
% 
% To get inter-line spacing right in LaTeX figure captions that are set smaller
% than body text:
% In the paper, do
% ```
%   \renewcommand{\captionfont}{\small}
% ```
% or
% ```
%   \renewcommand{\captionfont}{\small\bf}
% ```
% and use the following definition of \captionfont:
% ```
% \newcommand{\captionfont}{\bf}
% \long\def\@makecaption#1#2{
%    \vskip \baselineskip
%    \setbox\@tempboxa\hbox{\captionfont{#1: #2\strut}}
%    \ifdim \wd\@tempboxa >\hsize % IF longer than one line:
%        {\captionfont\noindent\parbox{\hsize}{#1: #2\strut}}\par     %   THEN set as ordinary paragraph.
%      \else                      %   ELSE  center.
%        \hbox to\hsize{\hfil\box\@tempboxa\hfil}
%    \fi}
% ```


== Tables

To reduce intercolumn space in tables:
```
  \addtolength{\tabcolsep}{-.5\tabcolsep}
  \setlength{\tabcolsep}{0pt}
```

Aligning decimal points (periods) in tables in TeX/LaTeX:
use dcolumn package (described in the LaTeX Companion).
In particular:
```
  \usepackage{dcolumn}
  % dcolumn customization
  \newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{.}{#1}} % argument is number of decimal places
  \newcolumntype{.}{d{1}} % "1" means one digit after the decimal point
  \newcolumntype{.}{d{-1}} % "-1" means center the decimal point in the column; ugly
  \newcolumntype{.}{d{0}} % "0" means decimal point is right-justified, not so different from right-justifying the column
  \newcolumntype{.}{d{5.1} % 5 places to the left of the decimal, one to the right
```
and then use "." as a column separator, much like "c".
These column separators do not check the number of decimal points in the
table itself.  Thus, using a value other than -1 can leave additional space
at the right side of the column, or let extra digits after the decimal
point lap into the next column.

To put a footnote within a table in LaTeX, surround the table with a minipage:
```
  \begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
  \begin{tabular}{ccc}
  1 & 2 & 3\footnote{Nothing important}\\
  4 & 5 & 6
  \end{tabular}
  \end{minipage}
```

To make entries in a LaTeX "tabular" table that span multiple columns,
as with the HTML "colspan" attribute, use an entry like
```
   \multicolumn{3}{l}{text}
```
where 3 is the number of columns to span, and "l" is the alignment of
the spanning contents. \multicolumn seems to want to insert
inter-column spacing around the contents even if you've tried to
disable it in the header line with @{} (or @{your amount of space}),
but you can override it by putting a negative version of the space on
the *inside* of the multicolumn, as in:
```
   \multicolumn{3}{l}{\hskip-\tabcolsep...}
```
Here is a "MultiColumn, One, Centered" macro:
```
  \newcommand{\mcoc}[1]{\multicolumn{1}{c|}{#1}}
```
To span multiple rows (as with the HTML "rowspan" attribute), use
\multirow:
```
  \usepackage{multirow}
  \multirow{nrows}[bigstruts]{width}[fixup]{text}
```
Multirow documentation is at
http://mirror.math.ku.edu/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/multirow/multirow.sty
The width is a size like "25mm" or `"*"` for "vertically centered".
The rows that donâ€™t contain the "multi-row" specification must have empty
cells where the multi-row is going to appear.
\multirow requires use of the multirow package:
You can nest \multirow in \multicolumn but not vice versa.



== Displays

To intersperse left-justified text with aligned equations, use the TeX
\noalign primitive. For example, 
```
  \begin{eqnarray}
  test & 1 & 2 \\
  \noalign{\hbox{left}}
  test & 3 & 4
  \end{eqnarray}
```
produces results like the following:
```
            test  1  2       (1)
  left
            test  3  4       (2)
```

Use
```
  \setlength{\arraycolsep}{.25em}
```
to reduce/compress the horizontal spaces (as around equal signs) between
columns in a LaTeX array or eqnarray environment.
Use
```
  \setlength{\tabcolsep}{.5\tabcolsep}
```
to reduce the width of columns in a table or tabular environment.



== Math mode

To define a (say) binary operator in TeX or LaTeX, use \mathord, \mathop,
\mathbin, \mathrel, \mathopen, \mathclose, \mathpunct, \mathinner.
These give "class" 1..8 to the math character or formula.
 * mathbin: for binary operators like "+"
 * mathrel: for binary relations like "=" (slightly more space)
 * mathop: for things like \sum, \cos, \ln, etc.
(There is no \binop or \binrel; I mention them here in case someone
searches for them.)

To typeset a multi-character identifier in LaTeX math mode, use
\mathit{...} (or, if you have it defined, \|...|) .  Never use $...$, which
puts incorrect kerning between the letters.  LaTeX typesets $myvar$ as "m
times y times v times a times r".  It looks bad, and enough people will
notice that it is worthwhile to get the typesetting right.


== Lists

To eliminate LaTeX list/itemize/enumerate spacing/space between items (by
setting \itemsep and \parskip), use
`\itemsep 0pt \parskip 0pt`.
This is necessary even if using `\usepackage{enumitem}`.

[Is this still the best approach with `\usepackage{enumitem}`?]
To control pre-list space, set \partopsep (or insert an explicit negative
\vspace (not \vskip)).  (I had to give an explicit argument, not -\parsep
etc.; but `\vspace*{-\partopsep}` worked for me if it came after the
\begin{enumerate}.)  (See manual page 167.)
<br>
To remove the vertical space from between two LaTeX trivlist environments:
```
   \vspace*{-\topsep}\vspace*{-\partopsep}\vspace*{-\itemsep}
```
  No combination of only two of these does the trick.
  (Why don't I have -\parskip here too?)

To reduce the indentation of a LaTeX list environment (itemize, enumerate,
description), do this *outside* the env.  It needs to come after `\begin{document}`.  (It's especially needed in the acmart style.)
```
  % Reduce indentation in lists.
  \setlength{\leftmargini}{.75\leftmargini}
  \setlength{\leftmarginii}{.75\leftmarginii}
  \setlength{\leftmarginiii}{.75\leftmarginiii}
```

In a LaTeX enumerate list environment, to insert an ordinary
(left-justified) paragraph of text without interrupting the item numbering,
do the following:
```
  \label{item:pre-break}
  \end{enumerate}
  PARAGRAPH GOES HERE.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \setcounter{enumi}{\ref{item:pre-break}}
```

To interrupt an enumerate environment, then continue the numbering later:
```
    \newcounter{saveenumi}
    ...
    \begin{enumerate}
      ...
      \item ...
      \setcounter{saveenumi}{\theenumi}
    \end{enumerate}
    ...
    \begin{enumerate}
      \setcounter{enumi}{\thesaveenumi}
      \item ...
      ...
    \end{enumerate}
```

To change the margins similarly to what the quote (`\begin{quote}`)
environment does:
```
 % Arguments are left and right margins
 \def\changemargin#1#2{\list{}{\rightmargin#2\leftmargin#1}\item[]}
 \let\endchangemargin=\endlist
 \begin{changemargin}{.05\columnwidth}{.05\columnwidth}
 \end{changemargin}
```



== Defining macros

Here are ways to test wither a macro argument is empty/null:
 1. The following macro definition will test whether a macro argument is empty:
```
    \def\mymacro#1{%
     \def\tempa{#1}\ifx\tempa\empty{then-part}\else{else-part}\fi
     }%
```
    Note that PLAIN.TEX defines \empty as follows:
```
    \def\empty{}%
```
    LaTeX defines \@empty in a similar way, if you want to work with .sty files.
    Note that since this uses \def to assign the value of #2 to a macro, it
    won't work in TeX's mouth, and needs the stomach as well (so it won't work
    inside an \edef for example).
 2. This way of testing for null arguments can be done entirely in TeX's mouth:
```
      \def\showempty#1{\message{\ifx\relax#1\relax empty\else not empty\fi}}
```
    It does however fail badly if #1 begins with \relax 
    (e.g., \showempty{\relax...}).
 3. Another way of testing for empty arguments in TeX's mouth is to say:
```
       \ifx\unlikely#2\unlikely ...true text... \else ...false text ... \fi
```
    This will expand to `true text' iff #2 is empty, or begins with
    \unlikely.  So if you make \unlikely an unlikely macro for #2 to begin
    with, then you're away.  (It also dies if #2 contains unbalanced \if,
    \else or \fi's, but that should be pretty rare.  Touch wood.)

LaTeX macros gobble space after them.  If you wish to insert space
(except before punctuation or other places where it shouldn't be
inserted) after a macro expansion, then add "\xspace" at the end of the
macro body.
```
  \usepackage{xspace}
  \xspaceaddexceptions{\%}
  \xspaceremoveexception{-}
  ...
  \newcommand{\restenergy}{\ensuremath{mc^2}\xspace}
  ...
  ... and we find \restenergy available to us ...
```

Here is a LaTeX command that typesets its argument in a smaller \tt font.  It
permits line breaks at spaces within the argument (but not within words),
respects current series (such as boldface), and works in both horizontal (text)
and math mode.
```
  \newcommand{\code}[1]{\ifmmode{\mbox{\smaller\ttfamily{#1}}}\else{\smaller\ttfamily #1}\fi}
```
Here's a version that takes care of URLs, too:
```
  \def\codesize{\smaller}
  %HEVEA \def\codesize{\relax}
  \newcommand{\code}[1]{\ifmmode{\mbox{\codesize\ttfamily{#1}}}\else{\codesize\ttfamily #1}\fi}
  \newcommand{\myurl}[1]{{\codesize\url{#1}}}
  %HEVEA \def\myurl{\url}
```
Or, if your document does `\usepackage{url}`, for URLs you can just do
```
  \renewcommand{\UrlFont}{\smaller}
```
but note that that is one command; you cannot specify `\smaller\texttt`.
 +
Similarly, "\scshape" is generally preferred to "\sc", because it
respects the typesetting of the current context.
For Verbatim environments, do this:
```
  \usepackage{fancyvrb}
  \RecustomVerbatimEnvironment{Verbatim}{Verbatim}{fontsize=\smaller}
```

// Can't unindent the LaTeX comments or the doc program will respect those
// comments.  That's unfortunate, because I typically unindent when inserting
// in a LaTeX document.

Here are definitions for identifiers in LaTeX math mode formulas:
----
  % \|name| or \mathid{name} denotes identifiers and slots in formulas
  \def\|#1|{\mathid{#1}}
  \newcommand{\mathid}[1]{\ensuremath{\mathit{#1}}}
  % \<name> or \codeid{name} denotes computer code identifiers
  \def\<#1>{\codeid{#1}}
  \protected\def\codeid#1{\ifmmode{\mbox{\sf{#1}}}\else{\sf #1}\fi}
  % Alternate definitions for \codeid
  % \protected\def\codeid#1{\ifmmode{\mbox{\ttfamily{#1}}}\else{\ttfamily #1}\fi}
  % \protected\def\codeid#1{\ifmmode{\mbox{\smaller\ttfamily{#1}}}\else{\smaller\ttfamily #1}\fi}
----
This alternate definition of `\codeid` does not work inside an array environments (see http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/27592/ ):
----
  \newcommand{\codeid}[1]{\ifmmode{\mbox{\ttfamily{#1}}}\else{\ttfamily #1}\fi}
----

To permit hyphenation in tt font globally throughout a document, see
http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/44361/how-to-automatically-hyphenate-within-texttt
However, all of those solutions give me a Roman font that differs from the text font, whereas I want a typewriter font.
`\usepackage[htt]{hyphenat}` doesn't seem to work either.



== Bibliographies and citations

Very simple BibTeX usage:
 # See ~mernst/bib for bibliographies (but you should get your own copy).
 # At beginning of document:   ((Why not at the end?))
   \bibliographystyle{alpha}
 # Within document:
   \cite{key}
 # At end of document:
   \bibliography{bibstring-unabbrev,invariants,dispatch,generals,alias}
 # Run latex, then bibtex, then latex again.

Typical LaTeX commands for bibliography:
```
  \bibliographystyle{alpha}
  \bibliography{bibstring-unabbrev,ernst,invariants,dispatch,generals,alias}
```

\thebibliography is defined in the main document style (article.sty, etc.).

For multiple bibliographies (say, one per chapter), use chapterbib.sty.

How can I permit line breaks in a citation?
I'm not sure if this is good style or not, but this is how to do it:
----
 % undo LaTeX's decision to make citation labels be \hbox'd.
 \makeatletter
 \def\@citex[#1]#2{\if@filesw\immediate\write\@auxout{\string\citation{#2}}\fi
   \def\@citea{}\@cite{\@for\@citeb:=#2\do
     {\@citea\def\@citea{,\penalty\@m\ }\@ifundefined
        {b@\@citeb}{{\bf ?}\@warning
        {Citation `\@citeb' on page \thepage \space undefined}}%
 {\csname b@\@citeb\endcsname}}}{#1}}
 \makeatother
----

BibTeX journal abbreviations are in /usr/local/lib/tex/bib/abbreviations,
which is pointed to by ~/tex/abbreviations.

The problem with BibTeX's cross referencing feature is that it puts the
book, proceedings, etc. in the bibliography as an entry of its own.
However, supplying argument -min-crossrefs=10000 disables this feature.

For mix-n-match BibTeX citations,
```
  \makeatletter
  \def\bibref#1{\nocite{#1}\@ifundefined{b@#1}{{\bf ??}\@warning
     {Citation `#1' on page \thepage \space 
      undefined}}{\@nameuse{b@#1```
  \makeatother
```
and then
```
  [\bibref{Horn86},p.86;\bibref{PressFTV88},p.516]
```
produces
  [50,p.86;75,p.516]
which is better than the
  [50,p.86],[76,p.516]
produced by
```
  \cite[p.~86]{Horn86},\cite[p.~516]{PressFTV88}
```

In LaTeX, to remove vertical spacing (space) between bibliography items, use:
```
   \setlength{\bibsep}{0pt}
```
before the `\biblography` command.

In LaTeX 2e, to adjust bibliography formatting:
(For IEEE styles, just do `\def\IEEEbibitemsep{0pt plus .5pt}`.)
  First, copy from article.cls the definition of
```
    \newenvironment{thebibliography}[1]
```
  Surround it by
```
    \makeatletter
    ...
    \makeatother
```
and change the "newenvironment" to "renewenvironment".
To make bibliography items less indented, do one or both of the these:
//nobreak

  1. Comment out
+
```
       \advance\leftmargin\labelsep
```
  2. Change
+
```
       \settowidth\labelwidth{\@biblabel{#1}}%
```
+
to
+
```
       \settowidth\labelwidth{~}%
```
{empty}
     (though this is a bit drastic).
To remove all vertical spacing (space) between bibliography items, add:
+
```
  % These two commands remove inter-bib-item spacing
  \setlength{\itemsep}{0pt}
  \setlength{\parsep}{0pt}
```

To use only first initials (not whole first name) in BibTeX, change "ff" to
"f." in the .bst file, on the line containing "format.name".
Or just use abbrv.bst, which does this.

To omit the month in BibTeX, change 
`{ month " " * year * }`
to
`'year`
in the .bst file.
This is rarely worthwhile, though:  the savings tend to be very small.

So that BibTeX does not require the publisher field in ACM conference
proceedings, make this change:
```

== Texinfo

In Texinfo, to prevent the last index pages from being numbered i, ii,
etc., add an @page before @summarycontents or @contents.

To format a texinfo file (ie, to produce a .dvi file from a .texi file), do
```
    tex foo.texi
    texindex foo.??
    tex foo.texi
```

Texinfo definitions can be done like this:
```
 @iftex @def@foo ...
```
Make sure that any usages of the macro are also put inside @iftex, and
make sure that you provide an equivalent construction inside @ifinfo.

Help for texinfo:
You might want to check out texinfo, a system for preparing both
high-quality typeset (by TeX) documents and on-line hypertext (viewable
from Emacs or a stand-alone viewer).  It's available from
prep.ai.mit.edu:/pub/gnu/texinfo-2.??.tar.Z.  There's also a latexinfo
system available from
tut.cis.ohio-state.edu:pub/gnu/emacs/elisp-archive/packages/LaTeXinfo.shar.*.Z.

LaTeXinfo takes a different input format than LaTeX -- for instance, there
are only three special characters (\{}), so comments are introduced by \c,
and so forth.  Thus, it could be a lot of work to convert a document into
LaTeXinfo.

Texinfo summary of cross reference commands (@xref @ref @pxref @inforef):
http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/texinfo.html#Cross-Reference-Commands

In Texinfo, to insert literal HTML, do
```
@html
<img src="https://travis-ci.org/typecheck-regex.svg?branch=master" alt="Travis codespecs/daikon status"/>
@end html
```
If `@` appears in the HTML, it must be quoted; this permits Texinfo commands
to appear within the HTML.
By contrast to `@html`, `@ifhtml` is a conditional but its body is regular
Texinfo.

Texinfo does not let you change the margins without changing 'texinfo.tex'
or 'texinfo.cnf'.  @pagesizes only affects the page size, not the margins.


== Hyphenization; word, line, and page breaking

raymond@sunkist.berkeley.edu (Raymond Chen) says:
To prevent word breaking (hyphenation) in (La)TeX, \hyphenpenalty=10000
Note, however, that although it'll work, it ain't exactly the nicest
thing to do to your CPU :-) +
Reason:  TeX will go ahead and hyphenate all the words in your
paragraph, and consider every possible breakpoint (including the
hyphens it inserted), but when it's just about ready to insert a hyphen,
it looks at \hyphenpenalty and say "Whoa!  Better not do it here."
This is repeated for every hyphenation point in every word of your
paragraph. +
A much more polite way to do it is to set the \hyphenchar to a
number not between 0 and 255; typically, -1 is used to suppress
hyphenation.  When the \hyphenchar is set to an invalid number,
TeX skips the hyphenation step altogether.  So you would say
something like
```
  \hyphenchar\the\font=-1
```
to suppress hyphenation for the current font.  If you use several
fonts, you'll want to set the \hyphenchar for each one.  So you
would start off like this:
```
  \hyphenchar\tenrm=-1
  \hyphenchar\ninerm=-1
  ...
```
You'll probably also want to set \defaulthyphenchar=-1 so that any
new fonts that get loaded will also have hyphenation disabled.
 +
Another way is
```
  \pretolerance=10000
```
and, if you get complaints about overfull hboxes, also add
```
  \emergencystretch=2em
```
or some bigger value.

piet@cs.ruu.nl (Piet van Oostrum) says:
To hyphenate words with imbedded hyphens, you must disable the hyphenchar
while reading the word and enable it while TeX hyphenates (i.e. at the end
of the paragraph).  Two ways to do this:
```
  \def\H#1{\setbox0=\hbox{#1}\unhbox0}
  \showhyphens{subsystem module \H{subsystem-module}}
```
or
```
  \edef\savehyphenchar{\the\hyphenchar\the\font}
  \hyphenchar\the\font=0
  \showhyphens{subsystem module subsystem-module
  \hyphenchar\the\font=\savehyphenchar} 
```

To have LaTeX hyphenate words with imbedded hyphens, you may use the
`breakable hyphen' command:
```
      \def\hyph{-\penalty0\hskip0pt\relax}
```
You could play tricks mapping it to a character that's made active for 
the purpose, but `-'?

LaTeX doesn't hyphenate (line-break) automatically when in font \tt because
in the customary uses for \tt fonts, one does not want TeX to insert any
hyphens.
Here are two workarounds:
 1. Insert explicit "\-" wherever you wish to permit hyphenization.
 2. Non-hyphenization is implemented by setting \hyphenchar of the tt fonts
    to -1.  You can undo it by explicitly resetting \hyphenchar.  To globally enable hyphenation in \texttt:
```
\DeclareFontFamily{\encodingdefault}{\ttdefault}{\hyphenchar\font=`\-}
```
or to enable it just for one family:
```
\DeclareFontFamily{T1}{cmtt}{\hyphenchar \font=45}
```

In LaTeX, \discretionary is a way to do custom hyphenization (without
necessarily using the hyphen character).  Use it like
```
  \discretionary{beforebreak}{afterbreak}{unbroken}
```
Examples:
```
  \discretionary{-}{}{}              % normal hyphenization; equivalest to: \-
  \discretionary{}{}{}               % no space, but permit break
  \discretionary{}{}{\,}             % thin space, or permit break
  \discretionary{/}{}{/}             % permit break after slash; equivalent to: /\discretionary{}{}{}
  \discretionary{}{.}{.}             % permit break before period (e.g., in URL)
  \discretionary{f-}{fi}{ffi}cult    % kerning
```

Redhat 6's (RH6's) LaTeX hyphenation is totally broken
because it uses all the different lanaguages hyphenation rules.
\usepackage[english]{babel}
fixes the problem by forcing it to use only English.


To permit more space between words, in order to prevent bad breaks in
narrow columns (like in a newspaper):
```
 {\spaceskip = \fontdimen2\the\font
 \advance\spaceskip by 0pt plus 0.5em
 \xspaceskip = \fontdimen7\the\font
 \advance\xspaceskip by 0pt plus 0.5em
 Several features were included in TRACEMAP to make it particularly
 useful for programmers who need to understand the behavior of
 their codes.}
 The most important part is a static pictorial representation of
 .. etc
```
This adds an extra 0.5em of stretchability to all spaces, producing big
spaces in the line. This modification is closed as soon as possible by the
} (could probably be earlier) to avoid having strange spacing further down
as a space is better than a hyphenation for TeX ... even one of these nasty
big ones - TeX can't tell the difference. \fontdimen2\the\font is the space
factor of the current font and 0.5em is the extra space factor.

\def\nopgbrk{\@nobreaktrue}

appears to prevent LaTeX page breaks, even just before lists.

To break a multi-line display math mode equation, use \begin{multline} or
the breqn package or the split environment provided by the amsmath package.

LaTeX can break an inline math mode formula at a \discretionary{}{}{} command.
It can automatically break the formula only when a relation symbol
(=, >, ...)  or a binary operation symbol (+, -, ...) exists and at least
one of these symbols appears at the outer level of the formula. Thus $a+b+c$
can be broken across lines, but ${a+b+c}$ cannot and neither can
$\left\langle ... \right\rangle$.
You can wrap parts of your formula in \mathrel or the like to fool LaTeX into
thinking there is a relation symbol at the outer level of the formula.
There is also \* which is discretionary multiplication sign:  "\times"
appears in the document only if the document is broken there.

From
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1703867/latex-how-to-put-line-break-in-a-math,
here is a definition of \mytuple that can be used as follows:
----
  $ \mytuple{ long\_text, other\_long\_text, more\_long\_text } $
----
----
% Permits line breaks after commas.  Use like this:
%   $ \mytuple{ longtext, otherlongtext, morelongtext } $
\makeatletter
\newcommand\mytuple[1]{%
  \@tempcnta=0
  \bigl\langle
  \@for\@ii:=#1\do{%
    \@insertbreakingcomma
    \@ii
  }%
  \bigr\rangle
}
\def\@insertbreakingcomma{%
  \ifnum \@tempcnta = 0 \else\,,\ \linebreak[1] \fi
  \advance\@tempcnta\@ne
}
\makeatother

Another solution, from http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/19094/allowing-line-break-at-in-inline-math-mode-breaks-citations :
----
\AtBeginDocument{%
  \mathchardef\mathcomma\mathcode`\,
  \mathcode`\,="8000 
}
{\catcode`,=\active
  \gdef,{\mathcomma\discretionary{}{}{}}

LaTeX's \underline{...} macro does not permit hyphenization (line breaking).
Instead, use
```
  \usepackage{soul}
  ...
  \ul{...}
```


== PDF and pdflatex

Regular TeX uses bitmap based fonts by default, so PDF looks bad for them.
To, use "pdflatex" on your tex documents, to use outline fonts instead (and
to generate PDF instead of .dvi.

When using the graphicx package to include figures in a LaTeX document:
The latex command requires all graphics/images/pictures to be in EPS format.
The pdflatex command requires all graphics to be in JPEG/JPG, TIFF, PNG, or PDF.
Therefore, all figures must appear in at least two different formats.

To convert .eps to .pdf, either of the following:
```
  # epstopdf seems to do a better job than convert
  epstopdf picture.eps
  # This version embeds fonts in the resulting PDF file
  GS_OPTIONS="-dEmbedAllFonts=true -dPDFSETTINGS=/printer" epstopdf myfile.eps
  convert file.eps file.pdf
  eps2pdf
  ps2pdf -dEPSCrop
  # a2ping is the successor to epstopdf
  a2ping
  # To embed fonts using a2ping
  a2ping --gsextra='-dEmbedAllFonts=true -dPDFSETTINGS=/printer'
```
To convert .pdf to .eps, either of the following ("convert" sometimes makes
huge .eps files, though "pdftops" creates more pixellated .eps files):
```
  convert file.pdf file.eps
  pdftops -f 1 -l 1 -eps
```
To include the pdf file:
```
  \usepackage{graphicx}
  ...
  % There should never be a .pdf (or any other) filename extension
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{picture}
  % For two-column layout:
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{picture}
```

To check whether fonts are embedded, run
```
  pdffonts myfile.pdf
```
or alternately use Adobe Acrobat Reader: go to "File --> Document
Properties --> Fonts".
This might tell you a font isn't embedded, but no output can also be a bad sign.

pdflatex creates a document with fonts embedded, so long as all your images
are bitmaps or are .pdf or .ps images with all their fonts embedded.

To embed fonts in a PDF document:
```
  gs -q -dSAFER -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=tmp.pdf -dCompatibilityLevel=1.5 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress -c .setpdfwrite -f file.pdf
```
This creates tmp.pdf with as many fonts embedded as are available on the
computer where you ran the command.

To embed the 14 base fonts (make them embedded fonts) in a PDF document,
when starting from a PostScript document:
```
  ps2pdf13 -dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress doc.ps doc2.pdf
```
Be sure to do this on PostScript that is generated by dvips, not on
PostScript that is generated by pdf2ps or similar programs.
(The instructions at http://users.rsise.anu.edu.au/~luke/embedded_fonts.html
that are supposed to make pdflatex embed the fonts did not work for me.)

You can set the compatibility level (e.g., PDF 1.7) in LaTex as follows:
```
\documentclass[10pt, conference]{IEEEtran}
\pdfminorversion=7
```
You can automatically embed all fonts in a PDF file, using ghostscript:
```
  gs -dCompatibilityLevel=1.7 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -sOutputFile=paper-with-embedded-fonts.pdf paper.pdf
```
R uses font symbols for outliers in a boxplot, and you may not be able to
embed them.  Minimally tweaking the opacity level of such points, forces R to
actually draw the points rather than replacing them with symbols:
```
geom_boxplot(outlier.colour=rgb(0, 0, 0, .99))
```


== URLs

To make hyperlinks (e.g., to URLs) in a LaTeX document:
```
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \url{http://www.wikibooks.org}
  \href{http://www.wikibooks.org}{Wikibooks home}
```
If you also want to line-break the URL text, then:
```
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage{url}
  \url{http://www.wikibooks.org}
  \href{\url{http://www.wikibooks.org}}{Wikibooks home}
```
More on LaTeX HEVEA URLs (\ahref, etc.):
  http://pauillac.inria.fr/~maranget/hevea/doc/manual018.html#toc22
but perhaps I want to ignore that and focus on using standard 


URLs in HTML and PDF documents:
```
 % Make a URL visible in PDF the but just be attached to anchor text in HTML:
 %BEGIN LATEX
 \newcommand{\ahreforurl}[2]{#2 (\url{#1})}
 %END LATEX
 %HEVEA \newcommand{\ahreforurl}[2]{\ahref{#1}{#2}}
```

The url package for LaTeX linebreaks a URL appropriately.
For a moving argument (or a URL containing characters like %), use
```
    \urldef{\myself}\url{myself%node@gateway.net}   or
    \urldef{\myself}\url|myself%node@gateway.net|
```
and then use "\myself" instead of "\url{myself%node@gateway.net}".
However, the hyperref package forbids URL line breaks; the workaround is
```
  \usepackage{hyperref}
  \usepackage{breakurl}
```

To typeset URLs in a smaller font in LaTeX, using \package{url}:
First approach (shorter, usually works):
```
  \def\UrlFont{\smaller\ttfamily}
```
Second approach (better style, possibly more robust):
```
  %% Define and use a 'smallertt' URL style.
  \makeatletter
  \def\url@smallerttstyle{%
    \@ifundefined{selectfont}{\def\UrlFont{\smaller\tt}}{\def\UrlFont{\smaller\ttfamily```
  \makeatother
  \urlstyle{smallertt}
```




== Hevea

As an alternative to hevea: pandoc or tex4ht or tth
  tex4ht is bundled with LaTeX distributions (use its make4ht build system instead of the htlatex command)
All 4 of these are actively maintained as of 2022.

Conditional compilation with LaTeX and Hevea:
To avoid problems with the imagen program, it's usually best to not
redefine macros with %HEVEA, but to use the \ifhevea conditional.

In LaTeX files, to avoid the "This document was translated from LaTeX to
Hevea" advertisement, write:
```
  %HEVEA \footerfalse    % Disable hevea advertisement in footer
```

Adding info to HTML header in Hevea (this must come after \begin{document}):
```
\let\oldmeta=\@meta
\renewcommand{\@meta}{%
\oldmeta
\begin{rawhtml}
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="my-favicon.png" />
\end{rawhtml}}
```

Testing whether a file exists, for both LaTeX and Hevea:
(Note that you need to test for a file, not a directory.)
```
 \newif\ifonbuffalo
 %HEVEA\makeatletter\@iffileexists{/scratch/secs-jenkins/java/jdk1.7.0/LICENSE}{\onbuffalotrue}{\onbuffalofalse}\makeatother
 %BEGIN LATEX
 \IfFileExists{/scratch/secs-jenkins/java/jdk1.7.0/LICENSE}{\onbuffalotrue}{\onbuffalofalse}
 %END LATEX
```

== Fonts

The default LaTeX fonts look bad on-screen.  Consider this alternative; the
"bitstream-charter" font family was designed to be good on screen.
```
\usepackage[bitstream-charter]{mathdesign}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}
```

In LaTeX, rather than
```
  \usepackage{times}
```
consider
```
  \usepackage{pslatex}
```
which differs in that it uses a specially narrowed Courier font.
(Also consider `\usepackage{palatino}`?
`\usepackage{times}` is narrower than `\usepackage{gentium}`.  \usepackage{venturis2} is even narrower, but it looks unnatural and makes it clear that you are cheating on space limits.)

Do not use
```
  \documentclass[sigconf,anonymous]{acmart}
  \usepackage{pslatex}
```
because it causes math-mode parentheses not to print.
`\usepackage{times}` doesn't work either.

To change fonts temporarily in LaTeX, use comands like the following
```
  {\fontfamily{phv}\selectfont Helvetica looks like this}
```
and
```
  {\fontencoding{OT1}\fontfamily{ppl} Palatino looks like this}.
```

The following six TeX document style options exist for using PostScript
fonts.
//nobreak

1. avantgarde, for using the Avant Garde family.
2. bookman, for using the Bookman family.
3. helvetica, for using the Helvetica family.
4. palatino, for using the Palatino family.
5. ncs, for using the New Century Schoolbook Roman family.
6. times, for using the Times Roman family

To use a thinner (narrower) version of a font in a LaTeX document, run the
following before running pdflatex:
```
  # Run with --clean once if the --xscale argument changes.
  #	/usr/share/doc/texlive-doc/latex/savetrees/makethin article.dvi --clean
	  -/usr/share/doc/texlive-doc/latex/savetrees/makethin article.dvi --pdftex --xscale=0.94
```

More attractive monospaced (typewriter, courier) fonts:
```
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
  % sans-serif monospaced font
  \usepackage{inconsolata}
```
```
  % serifed monospaced font
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
  \usepackage[scaled=0.88]{luximono}
```

Your LaTeX documents should always use
```
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
```
Even if you don't care about foreign languages, it has the advantage of
providing typewriter fonts for curly braces, and other characters that look
bad due to the fact that OT1 has only 128 glyphs and LaTeX has to get some
characters such as curly braces from a different font.
It particular, it solves the problem
```
  Font shape `OMS/cmss/m/n' undefined using `OMS/cmsy/m/n' instead for symbol `textbraceleft'
```

The default Computer Modern fonts are Type 3 (bitmap).  Here is how to use
"Latin Modern" fonts, which are a Type 1 reimplementation of the Computer
Modern fonts, and ensure you only get Type 1 fonts:
```
\usepackage{lmodern}
\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
```
However, it is easier and better to just use pdflatex, which will use the
good-quality type 1 "Blue Sky" implementation of Computer Modern.  Or use a
different font like Times.

If the line spacing is too large/big in a paragraph typeset in a smaller
font, then be sure to end the paragraph with \par.


== Everything else

LaTeX style files are found in the directories listed in the TEXINPUTS
environment variable.

Don't forget to check ~/tex/sty/ when looking for TeX files.

LATEX directory: see /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/misc, among others

LaTeX form letter:  use "merge" documentstyle option

Ragged right text in LaTeX:  use flushleft environment without explicit \\'s.
Another possibility is \pretolerance=10000 and \raggedright.

Use the \jobname command to get the name of the file that TeX is working on.
 +
Summary of UNIX-based methods for "portably" getting FILEID information of
.tex source into the output file:  (By portable, I mean that the .tex file
does not identify itself; at processing time, its location is obtained from
the system and encoded in the resulting output file.)
//nobreak

1. Use the ability of tex/latex to take information from the invocation.
  Here is a script that does this for a latex document, so that the variable
  \fileid can be used at will in the document and will expand to the absolute
  pathname with hostname prepended
+
```
 FN=`basename $1 .tex`.tex
 FILEID=`hostname`:`pwd`/$FN
 FILEID=`echo $FILEID | tr _ .`
 echo Inserting $FILEID...
 virtex "&"lplain \\def\\fileid{$FILEID}\\input $1
```
2. Use rcs or make.
3. Use a script and UNIX file-editing filters to replace tokens in the text
  with dynamically obtained environment information.

How can I make the pagestyle of the first page be empty (no page number)?
Put \pagestyle{empty} in the preamble (before \begin{document}).  This
works as long as you don't use \maketitle, which resets the pagestyle.  If
you use \maketitle, you have to place a \thispagestyle{empty} after the
\maketitle command, as well.

You can use MakeIndex to process a glossary (.glo file).  Here's an example
of a MakeIndex style-file you'd need:
```
keyword "\\glossaryentry"
preamble "\\begin{theglossary}\n"
postamble "\n\n\\end{theglossary}\n"
actual '='
quote '!'
encap '|'
level '>'
delim_0 "\\pfill"
delim_1 "\\pfill"
delim_2 "\\pfill"
lethead_flag 0
```
Use it with the command:
```
  makeindex -s glossary.ist -o your-file.gls your-file.glo
```

For alphabetic enumeration, do:
```
\newcounter{alphaenum@count}
\newenvironment{alphaenum}%
{\begin{list}%
{\alph{alphaenum@count})}%
{\usecounter{alphaenum@count}\def\p@alphaenum@count{\expandafter\@alph}}}%
{\end{list}}
```

In LaTeX, to make the first line of all sections etc be indented by the
usual paragraph indentation:
```
  \let\@afterindentfalse\@afterindenttrue
  \@afterindenttrue
```
OR, change the definition of \section (example from art10; '-' becomes '+')
```
  \def\section{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}{-3.5ex plus -1ex minus 
   -.2ex}{2.3ex plus .2ex}{\Large\bf}}
```
to
```
  \def\section{\@startsection {section}{1}{\z@}{+3.5ex plus +1ex minus 
   +.2ex}{2.3ex plus .2ex}{\Large\bf}}
```

To remove some of the extra whitespace around section headers:
```
  \usepackage[compact]{titlesec}
```

A simple LaTeX environment that keeps everything within it
on the same page:
```
 \def\window#1{\@need=#1\advance\@need\pagetotal
 \if\@need>\textheight\vfil\newpage\else\fi}
 %
 \newbox\@keepbox
 \newenvironment{keep}{%
   \setbox\@keepbox=\vbox\bgroup
 }{%
   \egroup\window{\ht\@keepbox}\box\@keepbox
 }
```
This works fine, except that if the \vbox is higher than textheight, it
overflows the page. So it needs to be broken up somehow.

TeX primitive \time is the number of minutes since midnight this morning.
Use it via \number\time.  For a timestamp, use it with \today (which
prints something like `August 7, 1989').
If you want something like ``13:48'' try the following:
```
 \def\clocktime{{\newcount\scratch
  \scratch=\time
  \divide\scratch by 60
  \number\scratch :\multiply\scratch by -60
  \advance\scratch by\time
  \number\scratch}}
```
Another version by Nelson Beebe, U. of Utah., is:
```
 % TIME OF DAY
 \newcount\hh
 \newcount\mm
 \mm=\time
 \hh=\time
 \divide\hh by 60
 \divide\mm by 60
 \multiply\mm by 60
 \mm=-\mm
 \advance\mm by \time
 \def\hhmm{\number\hh:\ifnum\mm<10{}0\fi\number\mm}
```

I once had to set
```
  \topskip = 0pt
```
to remove extra space before the first paragraph of a LaTeX document.

Marcel van der Goot's midnight macros (.tex and .doc files):
//nobreak

 * quire  Macros for making booklets, printing double pages, and printing outlines and crop marks.
 * gloss:  Macros for vertically aligning words in consecutive sentences.
 * loop:   A simple looping construct (meta-macros).
 * dolines: Meta-macros to separate arguments by newlines and by empty lines.
 * labels: Macros to print address labels and bulk letters.
   Do `tex make-labels' and then supply the label file name.
   There are other packages for labels, as well.

sober.sty reduces the spacing around section headings in the
default document styles.

In text with explicit line breaks, we can make a box just wide enough to
hold the widest one via (see LaTeX manual under tabbing for explanation):
```
  \newenvironment{centerlongestline}{\begin{center}\begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
     \begin{tabbing}}{\end{tabbing}\end{minipage}\end{center}}
```
Another alternative would be to use \begin{tabular}{l} ...
\end{tabular} rather than a tabbing environment, in which case
the minipage environment could be omitted entirely.

To capitalize (the first letter only of) a string in TeX, use
\caps{string}.  The string may contain macros and even embedded macros.
\def\caps#1{{\edef\tempa{#1}\expandafter\Caps\tempa}}
\def\Caps#1{\uppercase{#1}}

To number tables, figures, footnotes, consecutively through the entire
report (not by chapters) in LaTeX:
```
        \makeatletter
        \def\cl@chapter{}
        \@addtoreset{section}{chapter}
        \def\thetable{\@arabic\c@table}
        \def\thefigure{\@arabic\c@figure}
        \def\theequation{\arabic{equation}}
        \makeatother
```
One could also define
```
    \def\@takefromreset#1#2{%
        \def\@tempa{#1}%
        \let\@tempd\@elt
        \def\@elt##1{%
            \def\@tempb{##1}%
            \ifx\@tempa\@tempb\else
                \@addtoreset{##1}{#2}%
            \fi}%
        \expandafter\expandafter\let\expandafter\@tempc\csname cl@#2\endcsname
        \expandafter\def\csname cl@#2\endcsname{}%
        \@tempc
        \let\@elt\@tempd
    }
```
and then the solution to the original problem becomes:
```
        \@takefromreset{footnote}{chapter}
        \@takefromreset{table}{chapter}
        \@takefromreset{figure}{chapter}
        \@takefromreset{equation}{chapter}
        \def\thetable{\@arabic\c@table}
        \def\thefigure{\@arabic\c@figure}
        \def\theequation{\arabic{equation}}
```

From the ``Golden Rules of Macro Coding'' (for TeX)
  If a macro starts with \if..., put a \relax in front of it.
  \if... is not evaluated during the syntactic/semantic analysis, but
  during the lexical analysis. So there may be places where TeX scans
  ahead, and where the scan must be stopped, to allow a change to math
  mode before the test is done. An example where this may occur is
  within \halign's.

TeX code for definitions including multiple alternatives:
```
  \newcommand{\twolinedef}[4]{\left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
        #1 & \mbox{#2} \\
        #3 & \mbox{#4} \\
  \end{array} \right.}
```

To run TeX or LaTeX in batch mode on file foo.tex, do
```
  [la]tex \\batchmode \\input foo.tex
```
The doubled backslashes are for the shell; TeX will see just one of each pair.

6) How can I get TeX to see LaTeX \ref{...} as a _number_?
```
\def\alphref#1{\@ifundefined{r@#1}{?}{\edef\@tempa{\@nameuse{r@#1}}\expandafter
    \expandafter\expandafter\@alph\expandafter\@car\@tempa \@nil\null}}
```

LaTeX's \raisebox is like TeX's \smash:  change the apparent height of a
piece of text.

\negphantom is like phantom, but the space is negative, not positive.
----
\newcommand{\negphantom}[1]{\settowidth{\nplength}{#1}\hspace*{-\nplength}}
----

The useful LaTeX macro \ensuremath lets macros appear in either math or
horizontal mode; if the latter, it automatically switches to math mode.

To save space in a paper using the acmart style:
```
\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}
```
This does a bit more:
```
\settopmatter{printacmref=false} % Removes citation information below abstract
\renewcommand\footnotetextcopyrightpermission[1]{} % removes footnote with conference information in first column
\pagestyle{plain} % removes running headers
```
To add page numbers (useful during review):
```
\fancyfoot[C]{\thepage}
```

the copyright box):
```
  % Add page numbers, remove copyright box.  For submitted version only.

  \makeatother
```
In sigplanconf style, it's even easier:

To permit underfull hboxes in LaTeX, use 
```
\begin{sloppypar} ... \end{sloppypar}
```
I can't get `\sloppy` or `\begin{sloppy} ... \end{sloppy}` to work.
To disable the warnings globally, say `\hbadness=10000`, which
disables overfull hbox warnings too.

In LaTeX, 
to typeset text in a superscript or subscript, use A_{\mathit{pred}}

To produce a footnote without a footnote mark (as for a copyright notice in
the lower left-hand corner of a conference paper) in LaTeX, do this:
```
  \renewcommand{\thefootnote}{}
  \footnotetext{A version of this paper will appear in the 25th 
  Annual International Symposium on Computer Architecture, June 1998}
  \renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\arabic{footnote}}
```

To get a plain tilde character in LaTeX, do:  \textasciitilde.
This works even in \tt font.

In LaTeX, any character can be obtained by giving its ASCII code.
The left and right braces are, respectively, \char"7B and \char"7D.
Using \{ in \tt yields a Roman "{", it seems.  Here are macros that use the
\tt font:
```
  % Left and right curly braces in tt font
  \newcommand{\ttlcb}{\texttt{\char "7B}}
  \newcommand{\ttrcb}{\texttt{\char "7D}}
```

To set the page number in LaTeX:  \setcounter{page}{98}

Do not use math mode (such as $define$) for italics.  Instead, use
\emph{define} or \mathem{define}.  Math mode does not use ligatures and gets
interletter spacing wrong.
{empty} +
Here is text to send to someone who has misused math mode for italics:
{empty} +
You have improperly used TeX's math mode as a shortcut for producing words
in italic type.  This is ugly and distracting.  Instead of saying $START$
(which puts too much space between "T" and "A"), you should say {\em START}
or, in a formula, \mathit{START} or \mbox{\em START}.  (There are also
other good ways to get the same output.)  This small point will improve
readability and will build confidence that you have been careful throughout
your work.

The "beamer" package permits making nice slides with LaTeX.
(It's better than the "prosper" package, according to Stephen McCamant.)
"t" class option puts slide content at top rather than vertically centered.

Any LaTeX-Beamer slide containing a verbatim environment must start out:
```
  \begin{frame}[fragile]
```
(or [containsverbatim], though that's more typing)

In LaTeX-Beamer:
```
  \begin{frame}[shrink=5]   permits change of font size
  \begin{frame}[squeeze]    reduces vertical space
```

In TeX/LaTeX, to create a large "forall" symbol (which ordinarily is no
larger in display mode than in any other math mode), do something like
```
  \newcommand{\bigforall}[2]{{{\raisebox{-6pt}{\mbox{\Large$\forall$}$#1$}}\atop{\scriptstyle #2}}}
```

For a paragraph in a smaller font, on the smaller font's baseline
inter-line spacing (but it isn't permitted to be broken across columns), do
```
  {\small\noindent\parbox{\columnwidth}{\quad
  ...
  }
```

This defines a \Hline macro that is like \hline, but it has an independent

Derek Rayside says:
I wrote a little latex macro that lets one write things such as:
```
    \digraph{MyGraph}{a->b}
```
this produces MyGraph.dot with the contents:
```
    digraph MyGraph {a->b}
```
If you run dot to get MyGraph.ps (ie, dot -Tps -o MyGraph.ps MyGraph.dot),
then the \digraph macro will include the postscript file in your document.
The macro file is available at:
    http://web.mit.edu/~drayside/www/graphviz.tex/graphviz.tex
and a bit more documentation is at:
   http://web.mit.edu/~drayside/www/graphviz.tex/main.pdf

In LaTeX, use \enlargethispage to expand a page or column, fitting slightly
more text on it.

Tell TeX programs (from the teTeX distribution, which is standard on modern
Unix systems) to default to US-Letter-sized paper:
```
  texconfig xdvi us
  texconfig dvips paper letter
  texconfig dvipdfm paper letter
  texconfig pdftex paper letter
```
Alternately, a less desirable fix that only solves part of the problems above:
To make dvips produce lettersize output by default, edit config.ps (maybe in
/usr/share/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps or
/g2/local/lib/texmf/texmf/dvips/config/config.ps) to make sure the "letter"
pagesize block comes first; the first "@" block is the default.
(Otherwise, one must invoke dvips with the "-t letter" switch.)

Emacs "Local variables" section of a LaTeX file looks like one of the following:
```
 %%% Local Variables:

 %%% TeX-command-default: "PDF"

LaTeX Verbatim environment with embedded commands:
```
\usepackage{fancyvrb}
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\{\}]
...
\end{Verbatim}
```
Other initial lines:
```
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\|\[\]]
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\<\>]   % < and > cannot be used as delimiters
\begin{Verbatim}[commandchars=\\\<\>,numbers=left,numbersep=6pt,xleftmargin=12pt]
```
Or set parameters globally:
```
\fvset{fontsize=\small}
\fvset{fontsize=\relsize{-2}}
```
The fancyvrb package is preferable to:
//nobreak

 * the moreverb package.  (The moreverb documentation recommends fancyvrb!)
 * \alltt, which is built into LaTeX (except possibly for very simple tasks
   or use with Hevea)
 * listings (which breaks fancyvrb if both are loaded, and breaks wrapfigure
   if the lstlisting happens to be laid out across two pages).
   listings provides the lstlisting command, and inserts too much space
   between characters, which looks bad in any font (fixed- or variable-width).
   An advantage of listings is that it provides multi-character escapes to
   LaTeX code, so you don't have to find specific command characters that
   do not appear in the text (only multi-character sequences that don't appear.)
   listings can also boldface keywords, but that ends up looking very bad too:
   it's best to emphasize what is most important, which is never the keywords.
//nobreak

A disadvantage of fancyvrb is that Hevea only partially supports it; for
example, Hevea does not support the commandchars functionality nor its
`\VerbatimInput` command.  The Hevea manual (section B.17.12) recommends the
moreverb package.
Note that Computer Modern font has no bold fixed width font.
(See elsewhere in this file for solutions.)

The lstlisting package by default puts its line numbers in the column gutter.
To fix this, use:
```
  \begin{lstlisting}[xleftmargin=5.0ex]
```

To get bold fixed width (typewriter, teletype, tt) font in LaTeX, here are some options.
When using Computer Modern fonts), use
```
  \usepackage{bold-extra}
```
See installation instructions at
   http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=bold-extras
(which also offers other solutions).
Or, use underlining for emphasis.
Or, try a different font than Computer Modern.  For example, try
```
  \usepackage[T1]{fontenc}
  \usepackage{lmodern} % "latin modern", which has a boldface typewriter font
  \usepackage[lighttt]{lmodern} % lighter non-bold version (looks better)
  %\usepackage{luximono}
  %\usepackage[scaled=0.85]{beramono}
  \usepackage[T1]{lucidabr}
```
but if you use Lucida Bright, you probably want to scope the Lucida Bright to
only the verbatim text.
Courier also has regular and bold options, but it's considered very ugly.

To include a literal backslash (or other special characters) in a LaTeX
Verbatim (fancyverb) environment, use \SaveVerb and \UseVerb.
```
  \DefineShortVerb{\|}
  \SaveVerb{myname}|verbatim text \ _ ^|
  \UndefineShortVerb{\|}
  \UseVerb{myname}
```
Even simpler is the verbdef package:
```
  \usepackage{verbdef}
  \verbdef\mymacroname|verbatim text \ _ ^|
  \mymacroname
```

In LaTeX, as a general rule, backslashing punctuation characters inside
\code{} won't give you the right tt-font ones:  you need to either replace
\code with \verb or use \char and an ASCII code for the symbol, such as
```
  \renewcommand{\_}{\char"5F}
```
or, to get a backslash
```
  \newcommand{\bs}{\char"5C}
```

The llncs.cls style (class) file (and also sig-alternate.cls) does
```
  \let\footnotesize\small
```
which changes the font in footnotes.  This is an acceptable goal, but the
implementation is seriously flawed, since it makes it impossible to get
that size font in the program.  To fix this, find the "\newcommand" for
"\footnotesize" (perhaps in file `/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/base/size10.clo`
or in `/usr/share/texlive/texmf-dist/tex/latex/base/size10.clo`)
and copy it to the document after the "\documentclass" directive.

The PGF package for LaTeX makes drawings, much like LaTeX picture mode or
the pstricks package, but works with PDF and is much more powerful than
LaTeX picture mode.

To generate foo.sty (or foo.cls) from foo.dtx, run
```
  latex foo.ins
```
and then copy the resulting file somewhere appropriate.

TeX fonts are in /usr/local/lib/tex/fonts/tfm.

Aim to make your figure captions self-explanatory.  A short caption ("graph
of the results") forces readers to hunt through the text in order to
comprehend your results or your message.  Choose to place explanatory
sentences (such as describing the meaning of the rows, columns, or other
elements) in the caption itself; they take up no more space there, but are
easily located either by a careful reader or by someone flipping through
the document.  This also makes the figures more likely to draw readers into
the text.

Here is a definition of a \todo macro for LaTeX:
```
 \usepackage{color}
 %% Comment out one of these two definitions.
 % \newcommand{\todo}[1]{\relax}
 \newcommand{\todo}[1]{{\color{red}\bfseries [[#1]]}}
```
When using the \todo macro, don't leave space around it.  For example, write
```
  The approach is effective\todo{add citations}.
```
rather than
```
  The approach is effective \todo{add citations}.
```
because the latter would leave a space before the period when todo comments
are disabled.
Another way to say this is to always jam \todo against surrounding text
(either before or after, it doesn't matter).  If there is space both before
and after \todo, then when \todo is turned off, there are two spaces rather
than one at that location.
.
(An alternate definition of \todo would be
`\newcommand{\todo}[1]{\textcolor{red}{\textbf{[[#1]]}}}`
but that executes \leavevmode and so it cannot span paragraphs.)

Absolute value in LaTeX:

  \left| \frac{A+B}{3} \right|

Typesetting pseudocode in LaTeX:
http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=algorithms
Possible choices seem like
//nobreak

 * algorithmicx bundle, which includes the algpseudocode package and is compatible with the algorithm package, offers several environments.
   It's more flexible than algorithmic and is probably the best choice.
 * algorithms bundle, which provides the `algorithmic` and `algorithms` environments
 * clrscode
 * algorithm2e
    This is the one with the vertical lines (which I find ugly and
    distracting); I've had trouble wrestling with it in the past.
//nobreak

The algorithmic environment uses \STATE, \IF, \WHILE, \ENDWHILE...
The algpseudocode environment uses \State, \If, \While, \EndWhile...

To undo LaTeX's \frenchspacing: \nonfrenchspacing

In a two column (or at least twocolumn) document, \newpage doesn't give
you a new page; it just gives you a new column. An alternative that works
is \clearpage. (I think the other difference is that it also acts as a
fence for floats, but you often want that too anyway.)

To get extra space in a document:
```
  \renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{.994}
```
But that is terrible, so consider
```
  \enlargethispage{10pt}
```
in strategic locations.
Also helpful is 
```
  \usepackage{microtype}
```
after which only pdflatex, not regular latex, works.
The `makethin` program of the savetrees package creates thinner versions of
fonts.

To adjust section numbering in LaTeX (e.g., make subsubsections be numbered):
```
  \setcounter{secnumdepth}{3}
```
There is no `\subsubsubsection` command, but you can make `\paragraph` be numbered:
```
  \setcounter{secnumdepth}{4}
```

If a paragraph has only a word or two on its last line, try adding
----
\looseness=-1
----
to the end of it. If possible TeX will change line breaks to
reduce/shorten the length of the paragraph by a line. This won't always
work because there is a limit to how close TeX will move words. The longer
the paragraph, the more likely this trick is successful.

Ways to get a circled number in LaTeX with better formatting than \textcircled:
```
 % serif font:
 \usepackage{pifont}
 \newcommand{\numcircled}[1]{\ding{\numexpr171+#1\relax}}
 % sans-serif font:
 \usepackage{pifont}
 \newcommand{\numcircled}[1]{\ding{\numexpr191+#1\relax}}
 % Without using any extra packages
 \newcommand{\numcircled}[1]{\raisebox{.5pt}{\textcircled{\raisebox{-.9pt}{#1}}}}
```

Use `-O .` To make the latexrun script put auxiliary files in the standard
locations.  This means that standard commands such as `latex` and
`pdflatex` can find them, without having to run latexrun every time.

Ways to convert LaTeX to plaintext:
 * detex program (comes with LaTeX distributions):  `detex yourfile > yourfile.txt`
   opendetex supposedly improves detex but as of 9/2015 hasn't been updated since 10/2008
 * catdvi program, to retain formatting: `catdvi yourfile.dvi | fmt -u`
 * convert to PDF (disabling hyphenation), then use pdftotext
 * use pandoc

To make cleveref use a serial comma (sometimes called an Oxford comma):
```
\newcommand{\creflastconjunction}{, and\nobreakspace}
```

To get an en-dash instead of the word "to" when cleveref references multiple figures, you need to add
`\newcommand{\crefrangeconjunction}{--}`
to the preamble of the document.
Alternately, do this:
```
\usepackage{cleveref}
\crefrangelabelformat{section}{#3#1#4--#5\crefstripprefix{#1}{#2}#6}
\crefrangelabelformat{subsection}{#3#1#4--#5\crefstripprefix{#1}{#2}#6}
\crefrangelabelformat{equation}{(#3#1#4--#5\crefstripprefix{#1}{#2}#6)}
\crefrangelabelformat{figure}{(#3#1#4--#5\crefstripprefix{#1}{#2}#6)}
```


When using the cleveref package, use \Cref at the beginning of a sentence,
where you would capitalize a word.  Use \cref elsewhere, where you would
not capitalize a word.  If you want the words "Section", "Figure",
etc. capitalized throughout (this is personal preference, not a requirement
of English or of style guides), then do "\usepackage[capitalize]{cleveref}"
rather than mis-using \Cref where \cref belongs.

If you get an error
```
pdfTeX warning (ext4): destination with the same identifier (name{page.}) has
been already used, duplicate ignored
```
and your document does not have an index, then add the `pageanchor=false` option to the hyperref package:
```
\usepackage[pageanchor=false]{hyperref}
```

The `latexmk` program is distributed with LaTeX and so is a fairly
canonical way to run LaTeX until a fixed point
(as opposed to non-canonical ways, like the `rubber` program).
Here is a standard command line:
```
latexmk -bibtex -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode myfile.tex
```
latexmk's dependency tracking depends on file contents, not timestamps,
so you cannot make it re-run by `touch`ing a file, but you can do
`latexmk -C` to clean up all output or
`latexmk -gg ...` to clean then run.

To get less verbose LaTeX output:
```
latexmk -silent ...
```
However, this suppresses some error messages, so use:
```
latexmk -silent -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode myfile.tex || latexmk -gg -pdf -interaction=nonstopmode myfile.tex
```

For a single-colum, double-spaced version of an ACM LaTeX paper, for review:
```
\documentclass[acmlarge,anonymous,]{acmart}
\usepackage[doublespacing]{setspace}
```

To control formatting of a LaTeX paper from the command line, add to the paper:
```
\ifdefined\notodocomments
  \renewcommand{\todo}[1]{\relax}
\fi
```
and then invoke LaTeX like this:
```
pdflatex "\def\notodocomments{}\input{main}"
```
or, in a Makefile:
```
paper-notodos.pdf: paper.pdf
	pdflatex "\def\notodocomments{}\input{paper}"
	pdflatex "\def\notodocomments{}\input{paper}"
	cp -pf $< $@
```

Here is a way to get a LaTeX section caption to fit on one line:
```
\section{\fontsize{10.3pt}{13pt}\selectfont\mbox{Quantitative and Qualitative Analysis}}

  \noindent\textbf{Acknowledgments}
  \phantomsection\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Acknowledgments}

LaTeX font sizes:

\normalsize

In Latex, there should be a space before a citation, for example:
  one plus one is two \cite{authority}
It is conventional to use a non-breaking space (~) so the citation
doesn't start a line in the generated document:
  one plus one is two~\cite{authority}
Don't put a regular space before the non-breaking space:
  WRONG one plus one is two ~\cite{authority}

In LaTeX, `~' is a non-breaking space.  It should never be adjacent to
another space.  For example, do not write `text ~\cite{ref}` because that
will put two spaces between "text" and the citation, which looks bad.
Instead, write `text~\cite{ref}`.  Similarly, do not write `Figure
~\ref{fig:beautiful}` but write `Figure~\ref{fig:beautiful}`.

In LaTeX, always jam `\footnote` against the preceding text.  If you write
`text \footnote{...}`, then there is an ugly space between the text and the
footnote mark, and LaTeX might even put a line break or a page break
between them.

This change prevents an "underfull hbox" warning.
